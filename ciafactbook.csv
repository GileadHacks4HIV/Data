ARE,United Arab Emirates,AE,23-Dec-19,"The Trucial States of the Persian Gulf coast granted the UK control of their defense and foreign affairs in 19th century treaties. In 1971, six of these states - Abu Dhabi, &#39;Ajman, Al Fujayrah, Ash Shariqah, Dubayy, and Umm al Qaywayn - merged to form the United Arab Emirates (UAE). They were joined in 1972 by Ra&#39;s al Khaymah. The UAE&#39;s per capita GDP is on par with those of leading West European nations. For more than three decades, oil and global finance drove the UAE&#39;s economy. In 2008-09, the confluence of falling oil prices, collapsing real estate prices, and the international banking crisis hit the UAE especially hard. The UAE did not experience the &quot;Arab Spring&quot; unrest seen elsewhere in the Middle East in 2010-11, partly because of the government&#39;s multi-year, $1.6-billion infrastructure investment plan for the poorer northern emirates, and its aggressive pursuit of advocates of political reform. The UAE in recent years has played a growing role in regional affairs. In addition to donating billions of dollars in economic aid to help stabilize Egypt, the UAE was one of the first countries to join the Defeat-ISIS coalition, and to participate as a key partner in a Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen.","Middle East, bordering the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf, between Oman and Saudi Arabia","24 00 N, 54 00 E",Middle East,"83,600 sq km","83,600 sq km",0 sq km,slightly larger than South Carolina;

Successful efforts at economic diversification have reduced the portion of GDP from the oil and gas sector to 30%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the discovery of oil in the UAE nearly 60 years ago, the country has undergone a profound transformation from an impoverished region of small desert principalities to a modern state with a high standard of living. The government has increased spending on job creation and infrastructure expansion and is opening up utilities to greater private sector involvement. The country&#39;s free trade zones - offering 100% foreign ownership and zero taxes - are helping to attract foreign investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global financial crisis of 2008-09, tight international credit, and deflated asset prices constricted the economy in 2009. UAE authorities tried to blunt the crisis by increasing spending and boosting liquidity in the banking sector. The crisis hit Dubai hardest, as it was heavily exposed to depressed real estate prices. Dubai lacked sufficient cash to meet its debt obligations, prompting global concern about its solvency and ultimately a $20 billion bailout from the UAE Central Bank and Abu Dhabi Government that was refinanced in March 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UAEâ€™s dependence on oil is a significant long-term challenge, although the UAE is one of the most diversified countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council. Low oil prices have prompted the UAE to cut expenditures, including on some social programs, but the UAE has sufficient assets in its sovereign investment funds to cover its deficits. The government reduced fuel subsidies in August 2015, and introduced excise taxes (50% on sweetened carbonated beverages and 100% on energy drinks and tobacco) in October 2017. A five-percent value-added tax was introduced in January 2018. The UAE&#39;s strategic plan for the next few years focuses on economic diversification, promoting the UAE as a global trade and tourism hub, developing industry, and creating more job opportunities for nationals through improved education and increased private sector employment.&lt;/p&gt;",$696 billion,$382.6 billion (2017 est.),0.80%,"$68,600 ",28.5% of GDP,34.9% (2017 est.),12.3% (2017 est.),23% (2017 est.),1.8% (2017 est.),100.4% (2017 est.),-72.4% (2017 est.),0.9% (2017 est.),49.8% (2017 est.),49.2% (2017 est.),"dates, vegetables, watermelons;

AFG,Afghanistan,AF,23-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;Ahmad Shah DURRANI unified the Pashtun tribes and founded Afghanistan in 1747. The country served as a buffer between the British and Russian Empires until it won independence from notional British control in 1919. A brief experiment in increased democracy ended in a 1973 coup and a 1978 communist countercoup. The Soviet Union invaded in 1979 to support the tottering Afghan communist regime, touching off a long and destructive war. The USSR withdrew in 1989 under relentless pressure by internationally supported anti-communist mujahidin rebels. A series of subsequent civil wars saw Kabul finally fall in 1996 to the Taliban, a hardline Pakistani-sponsored movement that emerged in 1994 to end the country&#39;s civil war and anarchy. Following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, a US, Allied, and anti-Taliban Northern Alliance military action toppled the Taliban for sheltering Usama BIN LADIN.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A UN-sponsored Bonn Conference in 2001 established a process for political reconstruction that included the adoption of a new constitution, a presidential election in 2004, and National Assembly elections in 2005. In December 2004, Hamid KARZAI became the first democratically elected president of Afghanistan, and the National Assembly was inaugurated the following December. KARZAI was reelected in August 2009 for a second term. The 2014 presidential election was the country&#39;s first to include a runoff, which featured the top two vote-getters from the first round, Abdullah ABDULLAH and Ashraf GHANI. Throughout the summer of 2014, their campaigns disputed the results and traded accusations of fraud, leading to a US-led diplomatic intervention that included a full vote audit as well as political negotiations between the two camps. In September 2014, GHANI and ABDULLAH agreed to form the Government of National Unity, with GHANI inaugurated as president and ABDULLAH elevated to the newly-created position of chief executive officer. The day after the inauguration, the GHANI administration signed the US-Afghan Bilateral Security Agreement and NATO Status of Forces Agreement, which provide the legal basis for the post-2014 international military presence in Afghanistan. After two postponements, the next presidential election was held in September 2019.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Taliban remains a serious challenge for the Afghan Government in almost every province. The Taliban still considers itself the rightful government of Afghanistan, and it remains a capable and confident insurgent force fighting for the withdrawal of foreign military forces from Afghanistan, establishment of sharia law, and rewriting of the Afghan constitution. In 2019, negotiations between the US and the Taliban in Doha entered their highest level yet, building on momentum that began in late 2018. Underlying the negotiations is the unsettled state of Afghan politics, and prospects for a sustainable political settlement remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;","Southern Asia, north and west of Pakistan, east of Iran","33 00 N, 65 00 E",Asia,"652,230 sq km","652,230 sq km",0 sq km,almost six times the size of Virginia;

Much of the population continues to suffer from shortages of housing, clean water, electricity, medical care, and jobs. Corruption, insecurity, weak governance, lack of infrastructure, and the Afghan Government&#39;s difficulty in extending rule of law to all parts of the country pose challenges to future economic growth. Afghanistan&#39;s living standards are among the lowest in the world. Since 2014, the economy has slowed, in large part because of the withdrawal of nearly 100,000 foreign troops that had artificially inflated the countryâ€™s economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The international community remains committed to Afghanistan&#39;s development, pledging over $83 billion at ten donors&#39; conferences between 2003 and 2016. In October 2016, the donors at the Brussels conference pledged an additional $3.8 billion in development aid annually from 2017 to 2020. Even with this help, Government of Afghanistan still faces number of challenges, including low revenue collection, anemic job creation, high levels of corruption, weak government capacity, and poor public infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017 Afghanistan&#39;s growth rate was only marginally above that of the 2014-2016 average. The drawdown of international security forces that started in 2012 has negatively affected economic growth, as a substantial portion of commerce, especially in the services sector, has catered to the ongoing international troop presence in the country.

ATG,Algeria,AG,23-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;After more than a century of rule by France, Algerians fought through much of the 1950s to achieve independence in 1962. Algeria&#39;s primary political party, the National Liberation Front (FLN), was established in 1954 as part of the struggle for independence and has since largely dominated politics. The Government of Algeria in 1988 instituted a multi-party system in response to public unrest, but the surprising first round success of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in the December 1991 legislative elections led the Algerian army to intervene and postpone the second round of elections to prevent what the secular elite feared would be an extremist-led government from assuming power. The army began a crackdown on the FIS that spurred FIS supporters to begin attacking government targets. Fighting escalated into an insurgency, which saw intense violence from 1992-98, resulting in over 100,000 deaths - many attributed to indiscriminate massacres of villagers by extremists. The government gained the upper hand by the late-1990s, and FIS&#39;s armed wing, the Islamic Salvation Army, disbanded in January 2000.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Abdelaziz BOUTEFLIKA, with the backing of the military, won the presidency in 1999 in an election that was boycotted by several candidates protesting alleged fraud, and won subsequent elections in 2004, 2009, and 2014. The government in 2011 introduced some political reforms in response to the Arab Spring, including lifting the 19-year-old state of emergency restrictions and increasing women&#39;s quotas for elected assemblies, while also increasing subsidies to the populace. Since 2014, Algeria&amp;rsquo;s reliance on hydrocarbon revenues to fund the government and finance the large subsidies for the population has fallen under stress because of declining oil prices. Protests broke out across the country in late February 2019 against President BOUTEFLIKA&amp;rsquo;s decision to seek a fifth term. BOUTEFLIKA resigned on 2 April 2019, and the speaker of the upper house of parliament, Abdelkader BENSALAH, became interim head of state on 9 April. BENSALAH remained in office beyond the 90-day constitutional limit until Algerians elected former Prime Minister Abdelmadjid TEBBOUNE as the country&#39;s new president in December 2019.&lt;/p&gt;","Northern Africa, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Morocco and Tunisia","28 00 N, 3 00 E",Africa,"2,381,740 sq km","2,381,740 sq km",0 sq km,slightly less than 3.5 times the size of Texas,"6,734 km","Libya 989 km, Mali 1359 km, Mauritania 460 km, Morocco 1900 km, Niger 951 km, Tunisia 1034 km, Western Sahara 41 km",998 km,12 nm,,,,"arid to semiarid;

In recent years the Algerian Government has halted the privatization of state-owned industries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy, pursuing an explicit import substitution policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydrocarbons have long been the backbone of the economy, accounting for roughly 30% of GDP, 60% of budget revenues, and nearly 95% of export earnings. Algeria has the 10th-largest reserves of natural gas in the world - including the 3rd-largest reserves of shale gas - and is the 6th-largest gas exporter. It ranks 16th in proven oil reserves. Hydrocarbon exports enabled Algeria to maintain macroeconomic stability, amass large foreign currency reserves, and maintain low external debt while global oil prices were high. With lower oil prices since 2014, Algeriaâ€™s foreign exchange reserves have declined by more than half and its oil stabilization fund has decreased from about $20 billion at the end of 2013 to about $7 billion in 2017, which is the statutory minimum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Declining oil prices have also reduced the governmentâ€™s ability to use state-driven growth to distribute rents and fund generous public subsidies, and the government has been under pressure to reduce spending. Over the past three years, the government has enacted incremental increases in some taxes, resulting in modest increases in prices for gasoline, cigarettes, alcohol, and certain imported goods, but it has refrained from reducing subsidies, particularly for education, healthcare, and housing programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Algiers has increased protectionist measures since 2015 to limit its import bill and encourage domestic production of non-oil and gas industries. Since 2015, the government has imposed additional restrictions on access to foreign exchange for imports, and import quotas for specific products, such as cars. In January 2018 the government imposed an indefinite suspension on the importation of roughly 850 products, subject to periodic review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President BOUTEFLIKA announced in fall 2017 that Algeria intends to develop its non-conventional energy resources. Algeria has struggled to develop non-hydrocarbon industries because of heavy regulation and an emphasis on state-driven growth. Algeria has not increased non-hydrocarbon exports, and hydrocarbon exports have declined because of field depletion and increased domestic demand.&lt;/p&gt;",$630 billion,$167.6 billion (2017 est.),1.40%,"$15,200 ",37.8% of GDP,42.7% (2017 est.),20.2% (2017 est.),38.1% (2017 est.),11.2% (2017 est.),23.6% (2017 est.),-35.8% (2017 est.),13.3% (2017 est.),39.3% (2017 est.),47.4% (2017 est.),"wheat, barley, oats, grapes, olives, citrus, fruits;

However, about a decade after independence from France in 1962, the total fertility rate fell dramatically from 7 children per woman in the 1970s to about 2.4 in 2000, slowing Algeria&#39;s population growth rate by the late 1980s. The lower fertility rate was mainly the result of women&#39;s rising age at first marriage (virtually all Algerian children being born in wedlock) and to a lesser extent the wider use of contraceptives. Later marriages and a preference for smaller families are attributed to increases in women&#39;s education and participation in the labor market; higher unemployment; and a shortage of housing forcing multiple generations to live together. The average woman&#39;s age at first marriage increased from about 19 in the mid-1950s to 24 in the mid-1970s to 30.5 in the late 1990s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Algeria&#39;s fertility rate experienced an unexpected upturn in the early 2000s, as the average woman&#39;s age at first marriage dropped slightly. The reversal in fertility could represent a temporary fluctuation in marriage age or, less likely, a decrease in the steady rate of contraceptive use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thousands of Algerian peasants - mainly Berber men from the Kabylia region - faced with land dispossession and economic hardship under French rule migrated temporarily to France to work in manufacturing and mining during the first half of the 20th century. This movement accelerated during World War I, when Algerians filled in for French factory workers or served as soldiers. In the years following independence, low-skilled Algerian workers and Algerians who had supported the French (known as Harkis) emigrated en masse to France. Tighter French immigration rules and Algiers&#39; decision to cease managing labor migration to France in the 1970s limited legal emigration largely to family reunification.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not until Algeria&#39;s civil war in the 1990s did the country again experience substantial outmigration. Many Algerians legally entered Tunisia without visas claiming to be tourists and then stayed as workers. Other Algerians headed to Europe seeking asylum, although France imposed restrictions. Sub-Saharan African migrants came to Algeria after its civil war to work in agriculture and mining. In the 2000s, a wave of educated Algerians went abroad seeking skilled jobs in a wider range of destinations, increasing their presence in North America and Spain. At the same time, legal foreign workers principally from China and Egypt came to work in Algeria&#39;s construction and oil sectors. Illegal migrants from sub-Saharan Africa, particularly Malians, Nigeriens, and Gambians, continue to come to Algeria in search of work or to use it as a stepping stone to Libya and Europe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since 1975, Algeria also has been the main recipient of Sahrawi refugees from the ongoing conflict in Western Sahara. More than 1000,000 Sahrawis are estimated to be living in five refugee camps in southwestern Algeria near Tindouf.&lt;/p&gt;","3,973 km (2014)","2,888 km 1.432-m gauge (283 km electrified) (2014)","1,085 km 1.055-m gauge (2014)","&lt;strong&gt;aim: &lt;/strong&gt;overthrow various African regimes and replace them with one ruled by sharia; establish a regional Islamic caliphate across all of North and West Africa&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;area(s) of operation: &lt;/strong&gt;based in southern and eastern Algeria (including isolated parts of the Kabylie region); also operates in Burkina Faso, Cote D&amp;rsquo;Ivoire, Libya, northern Mali, Niger, and Tunisia&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;note:&lt;/strong&gt; al-Qa&#39;ida&#39;s affiliate in North Africa; Tunisia-based branch known as the Uqbah bin Nafi Battalion; Mali-based cadre merged with allies to form Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) in March 2017, which pledged allegiance to AQIM and al-Qa&#39;ida (2019)","&lt;strong&gt;aim(s):&lt;/strong&gt; replace the Algerian Government with an Islamic state and implement ISIS&#39;s strict interpretation of sharia;&amp;nbsp; attack Algerian security services, local government targets, and Western interests&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;area(s) of operation:&lt;/strong&gt; maintains an operational and recruitment presence mostly in the northeast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;note:&lt;/strong&gt; formerly known as Jund al-Khilafa - Algeria (JAK-A) (2019)","&lt;strong&gt;aim(s):&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt; expel Westerners from North and West Africa; create Islamic state&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;area(s) of operation:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;most active in Mali, but claimed responsibility for the January 2013 attack against the Tiguentourine gas facility near In Amenas, in southeastern Algeria (2018)","more than 100,000 (Western Saharan Sahrawi, mostly living in Algerian-sponsored camps in the southwestern Algerian town of Tindouf) (2018)","Algeria is a transit and, to a lesser extent, a destination and source country for women subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking and, to a lesser extent, men subjected to forced labor; criminal networks, sometimes extending to sub-Saharan Africa and to Europe, are involved in human smuggling and trafficking in Algeria; sub-Saharan adults enter Algeria voluntarily but illegally, often with the aid of smugglers, for onward travel to Europe, but some of the women are forced into prostitution, domestic service, and begging; some sub-Saharan men, mostly from Mali, are forced into domestic servitude; some Algerian women and children are also forced into prostitution domestically","Tier 3 â€“ Algeria does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so: some officials denied the existence of human trafficking, hindering law enforcement efforts; the government reported its first conviction under its anti-trafficking law; one potential trafficking case was investigated in 2014, but no suspected offenders were arrested; no progress was made in identifying victims among vulnerable groups or referring them to NGO-run protection service, which left trafficking victims subject to arrest and detention; no anti-trafficking public awareness or educational campaigns were conducted (2015)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ALB,Albania,AL,29-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;Albania declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912, but was conquered by Italy in 1939 and occupied by Germany in 1943. Communist partisans took over the country in 1944. Albania allied itself first with the USSR (until 1960), and then with China (to 1978). In the early 1990s, Albania ended 46 years of&amp;nbsp;isolated communist rule and established a multiparty democracy. The transition has proven challenging as successive governments have tried to deal with high unemployment, widespread corruption, dilapidated infrastructure, powerful organized crime networks, and combative political opponents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Albania has made progress in its democratic development since it first&amp;nbsp;held multiparty elections in 1991, but deficiencies remain. Most of Albania&#39;s post-communist elections were marred by claims of electoral fraud; however, international observers judged elections to be largely free and fair since the restoration of political stability following the collapse of pyramid schemes in 1997. Albania joined NATO in April 2009 and in June 2014 became an EU&amp;nbsp;candidate. Albania in April 2017 received a European Commission recommendation to open EU accession negotiations following the passage of historic EU-mandated justice reforms in 2016. Although Albania&#39;s economy continues to grow, it has slowed, and the country is still one of the poorest in Europe.

Albania managed to weather the first waves of the global financial crisis but, the negative effects of the crisis caused a significant economic slowdown. Since 2014, Albania&amp;rsquo;s economy has steadily improved and economic growth reached 3.8% in 2017. However, close trade, remittance, and banking sector ties with Greece and Italy make Albania vulnerable to spillover effects of possible debt crises and weak growth in the euro zone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Remittances, a significant catalyst for economic growth, declined from 12-15% of GDP before the 2008 financial crisis to 5.8% of GDP in 2015, mostly from Albanians residing in Greece and Italy. The agricultural sector, which accounts for more than 40% of employment but less than one quarter of GDP, is limited primarily to small family operations and subsistence farming, because of a lack of modern equipment, unclear property rights, and the prevalence of small, inefficient plots of land. Complex tax codes and licensing requirements, a weak judicial system, endemic corruption, poor enforcement of contracts and property issues, and antiquated infrastructure contribute to Albania&#39;s poor business environment making attracting foreign investment difficult. Since 2015, Albania has launched an ambitious program to increase tax compliance and bring more businesses into the formal economy. In July 2016, Albania passed constitutional amendments reforming the judicial system in order to strengthen the rule of law and to reduce deeply entrenched corruption.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Albania&amp;rsquo;s electricity supply is uneven despite upgraded transmission capacities with neighboring countries. However, the government has recently taken steps to stem non-technical losses and has begun to upgrade the distribution grid. Better enforcement of electricity contracts has improved the financial viability of the sector, decreasing its reliance on budget support. Also, with help from international donors, the government is taking steps to improve the poor road and rail networks, a long standing barrier to sustained economic growth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Inward foreign direct investment has increased significantly in recent years as the government has embarked on an ambitious program to improve the business climate through fiscal and legislative reforms. The government is focused on the simplification of licensing requirements and tax codes, and it entered into a new arrangement with the IMF for additional financial and technical support. Albania&amp;rsquo;s three-year IMF program, an extended fund facility arrangement, was successfully concluded in February 2017. The Albanian Government has strengthened tax collection amid moderate public wage and pension increases in an effort to reduce its budget deficit. The country continues to face high public debt, exceeding its former statutory limit of 60% of GDP in 2013 and reaching 72% in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;",$36.01 billion,$13.07 billion (2017 est.),3.80%,"$12,500 ",15.9% of GDP,78.1% (2017 est.),11.5% (2017 est.),25.2% (2017 est.),0.2% (2017 est.),31.5% (2017 est.),-46.6% (2017 est.),21.7% (2017 est.),24.2% (2017 est.),54.1% (2017 est.),"wheat, corn, potatoes, vegetables, fruits, olives and olive oil, grapes;

ARM,Armenia,AM,17-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;Armenia prides itself on being the first nation to formally adopt Christianity (early 4th century). Despite periods of autonomy, over the centuries Armenia came under the sway of various empires including the Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Persian, and Ottoman. During World War I in the western portion of Armenia, the Ottoman Empire instituted a policy of forced resettlement coupled with other harsh practices that resulted in at least 1 million Armenian deaths. The eastern area of Armenia was ceded by the Ottomans to Russia in 1828; this portion declared its independence in 1918, but was conquered by the Soviet Red Army in 1920.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Armenia remains involved in the protracted Nagorno-Karabakh conflict with Azerbaijan. Nagorno-Karabakh was a primarily ethnic Armenian region that Moscow recognized in 1923 as an autonomous oblast within Soviet Azerbaijan. In the late Soviet period, a separatist movement developed which sought to end Azerbaijani control over the region. Fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh began in 1988 and escalated after Armenia and Azerbaijan attained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. By the time a ceasefire took effect in May 1994, separatists, with Armenian support, controlled Nagornoâ€‘Karabakh and seven surrounding Azerbaijani territories. The 1994 ceasefire continues to hold, although violence continues along the line of contact separating the opposing forces, as well as the Armenia-Azerbaijan international border. The final status of Nagorno-Karabakh remains the subject of international mediation by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group, which works to help the sides settle the conflict peacefully. The OSCE Minsk Group is coâ€‘chaired by the US, France, and Russia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Turkey closed the common border with Armenia in 1993 in support of Azerbaijan in its conflict with Armenia over control of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas, further hampering Armenian economic growth. In 2009, Armenia and Turkey signed Protocols normalizing relations between the two countries, but neither country ratified the Protocols, and Armenia officially withdrew from the Protocols in March 2018. In 2015, Armenia joined the Eurasian Economic Union alongside Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. In November 2017, Armenia signed a Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with the EU. In spring 2018, Serzh SARGSIAN of the Republican Party of Armenia (RPA) stepped down and Civil Contract party leader Nikol PASHINYAN became prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;","Southwestern Asia, between Turkey (to the west) and Azerbaijan; note - Armenia views itself as part of Europe; geopolitically, it can be classified as falling within Europe, the Middle East, or both","40 00 N, 45 00 E",Asia,"29,743 sq km","28,203 sq km","1,540 sq km",slightly smaller than Maryland,"1,570 km","Azerbaijan 996 km, Georgia 219 km, Iran 44 km, Turkey 311 km",0 km (landlocked),,,,,"highland continental, hot summers, cold winters",Armenian Highland with mountains; little forest land; fast flowing rivers; good soil in Aras River valley,"1,792 m",Debed River 400 m,"Aragats Lerrnagagat&#39; 4,090 m","small deposits of gold, copper, molybdenum, zinc, bauxite",59.7% (2016 est.),15.8% (2016 est.),1.9% (2016 est.),42% (2016 est.),9.1% (2016 est.),31.2% (2016 est.),"2,740 sq km (2012)","most of the population is located in the northern half of the country; the capital of Yerevan is home to more than five times as many people as Gyumri, the second largest city in the country",occasionally severe earthquakes; droughts,"soil pollution from toxic chemicals such as DDT; deforestation; pollution of Hrazdan and Aras Rivers; the draining of Sevana Lich (Lake Sevan), a result of its use as a source for hydropower, threatens drinking water supplies; restart of Metsamor nuclear power plant in spite of its location in a seismically active zone","Air Pollution, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Wetlands",Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants,landlocked in the Lesser Caucasus Mountains; Sevana Lich (Lake Sevan) is the largest lake in this mountain range,"3,038,217 (July 2018 est.)",Armenian(s),Armenian,"Armenian 98.1%, Yezidi (Kurd) 1.2%, other 0.7% (2011 est.)","Armenian (official) 97.9%, Kurdish (spoken by Yezidi minority) 1%, other 1% (2011 est.)","Armenian Apostolic 92.6%, Evangelical 1%, other 2.4%, none 1.1%, unspecified 2.9% (2011 est.)","18.86% (male 303,712 /female 269,279)","12.37% (male 195,722 /female 179,970)","43.31% (male 640,089 /female 675,643)","13.77% (male 192,515 /female 225,882)","11.7% (male 142,835 /female 212,570) (2018 est.)",44.4 (2015 est.),28.7 (2015 est.),15.8 (2015 est.),6.3 (2015 est.),35.6 years (2018 est.),33.9 years,37.4 years,-0.25% (2018 est.),"12.6 births/1,000 population (2018 est.)","9.5 deaths/1,000 population (2018 est.)","-5.6 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2018 est.)",63.2% of total population (2019),0.22% annual rate of change (2015-20 est.),1.083 million YEREVAN (capital) (2019),1.11 male(s)/female,1.13 male(s)/female,1.09 male(s)/female,0.95 male(s)/female,0.85 male(s)/female,0.67 male(s)/female,0.94 male(s)/female (2018 est.),"26 deaths/100,000 live births (2017 est.)","12.3 deaths/1,000 live births (2018 est.)","13.7 deaths/1,000 live births","10.7 deaths/1,000 live births",75.1 years (2018 est.),71.8 years,78.7 years,1.64 children born/woman (2018 est.),100% of population,100% of population,100% of population,0% of population,0% of population,0% of population (2015 est.),9.9% (2016),"2.9 physicians/1,000 population (2014)","4.2 beds/1,000 population (2015)",96.2% of population (2015 est.),78.2% of population (2015 est.),89.5% of population (2015 est.),3.8% of population (2015 est.),21.8% of population (2015 est.),10.5% of population (2015 est.),0.2% (2018 est.),"3,500 (2018 est.)", &lt;200 (2018 est.),20.2% (2016),2.7% of GDP (2017),age 15 and over can read and write,99.70%,99.70%,99.6% (2015),13 years,13 years,13 years (2015),36.30%,29.50%,45.7% (2016 est.),Republic of Armenia,Armenia,Hayastani Hanrapetut&#39;yun,Hayastan,"Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, Armenian Republic",,"the etymology of the country&#39;s name remains obscure; according to tradition, the country is named after Hayk, the legendary patriarch of the Armenians and the great-great-grandson of Noah; Hayk&#39;s descendant, Aram, purportedly is the source of the name Armenia",parliamentary democracy; note - constitutional changes adopted in December 2015 transformed the government to a parliamentary system,Yerevan,"40 10 N, 44 30 E","UTC+4 (9 hours ahead of Washington, DC, during Standard Time)","11 provinces (marzer, singular - marz); Aragatsotn, Ararat, Armavir, Geghark&#39;unik&#39;, Kotayk&#39;, Lorri, Shirak, Syunik&#39;, Tavush, Vayots&#39; Dzor, Yerevan","21 September 1991 (from the Soviet Union); notable earlier dates: 321 B.C.

Armenia has since switched to small-scale agriculture and away from the large agro industrial complexes of the Soviet era. Armenia has only two open trade borders - Iran and Georgia - because its borders with Azerbaijan and Turkey have been closed since 1991 and 1993, respectively, as a result of Armenia&#39;s ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the separatist Nagorno-Karabakh region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armenia joined the World Trade Organization in January 2003. The government has made some improvements in tax and customs administration in recent years, but anti-corruption measures have been largely ineffective. Armenia will need to pursue additional economic reforms and strengthen the rule of law in order to raise its economic growth and improve economic competitiveness and employment opportunities, especially given its economic isolation from Turkey and Azerbaijan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armenia&#39;s geographic isolation, a narrow export base, and pervasive monopolies in important business sectors have made it particularly vulnerable to volatility in the global commodity markets and the economic challenges in Russia. Armenia is particularly dependent on Russian commercial and governmental support, as most key Armenian infrastructure is Russian-owned and/or managed, especially in the energy sector. Remittances from expatriates working in Russia are equivalent to about 12-14% of GDP.

AGO,Angola,AO,27-Dec-19,"Angola scores low on human development indexes despite using its large oil reserves to rebuild since the end of a 27-year civil war in 2002. Fighting between the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), led by Jose Eduardo DOS SANTOS, and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), led by Jonas SAVIMBI, followed independence from Portugal in 1975. Peace seemed imminent in 1992 when Angola held national elections, but fighting picked up again in 1993. Up to 1.5 million lives may have been lost - and 4 million people displaced - during the more than a quarter century of fighting. SAVIMBI&#39;s death in 2002 ended UNITA&#39;s insurgency and cemented the MPLA&#39;s hold on power. DOS SANTOS stepped down from the presidency in 2017, having led the country since 1979. He pushed through a new constitution in 2010.

(Forward Angola),Manuel Rui Alves MONTEIRO/Rui Alberto Vieira Dias MINGAO,"&lt;p&gt;Angola&#39;s economy is overwhelmingly driven by its oil sector. Oil production and its supporting activities contribute about 50% of GDP, more than 70% of government revenue, and more than 90% of the country&#39;s exports; Angola is an OPEC member and subject to its direction regarding oil production levels. Diamonds contribute an additional 5% to exports. Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for most of the people, but half of the country&#39;s food is still imported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased oil production supported growth averaging more than 17% per year from 2004 to 2008. A postwar reconstruction boom and resettlement of displaced persons led to high rates of growth in construction and agriculture as well. Some of the country&#39;s infrastructure is still damaged or undeveloped from the 27-year-long civil war (1975-2002). However, the government since 2005 has used billions of dollars in credit from China, Brazil, Portugal, Germany, Spain, and the EU to help rebuild Angola&#39;s public infrastructure. Land mines left from the war still mar the countryside, and as a result, the national military, international partners, and private Angolan firms all continue to remove them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global recession that started in 2008 stalled Angolaâ€™s economic growth and many construction projects stopped because Luanda accrued billions in arrears to foreign construction companies when government revenue fell. Lower prices for oil and diamonds also resulted in GDP falling 0.7% in 2016. Angola formally abandoned its currency peg in 2009 but reinstituted it in April 2016 and maintains an overvalued exchange rate. In late 2016, Angola lost the last of its correspondent relationships with foreign banks, further exacerbating hard currency problems. Since 2013 the central bank has consistently spent down reserves to defend the kwanza, gradually allowing a 40% depreciation since late 2014. Consumer inflation declined from 325% in 2000 to less than 9% in 2014, before rising again to above 30% from 2015-2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continued low oil prices, the depreciation of the kwanza, and slower than expected growth in non-oil GDP have reduced growth prospects, although several major international oil companies remain in Angola.

In 2012, the UN assessed that conditions in Angola had been stable for several years and invoked a cessation of refugee status for Angolans. Following the cessation clause, some of those still in exile returned home voluntarily through UN repatriation programs, and others integrated into host countries.&lt;/p&gt;","2,852 km (2014)",,"2,729 km 1.067-m gauge (2014)",,,,"6,448 (Cote d&#39;Ivoire), 5,709 (Mauritania) (2017); 22,463 (Democratic Republic of the Congo) (refugees and asylum seekers) (2019)",,,,,,,schistosomiasis (2019),rabies (2019),15% (2003 est.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ARG,Argentina,AR,17-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;In 1816, the United Provinces of the Rio Plata declared their independence from Spain. After Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay went their separate ways, the area that remained became Argentina. The country&#39;s population and culture were heavily shaped by immigrants from throughout Europe, with Italy and Spain providing the largest percentage of newcomers from 1860 to 1930. Up until about the mid-20th century, much of Argentina&#39;s history was dominated by periods of internal political unrest and conflict between civilian and military factions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After World War II, an era of Peronist populism and direct and indirect military interference in subsequent governments was followed by a military junta that took power in 1976. Democracy returned in 1983 after a failed bid to seize the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) by force, and has persisted despite numerous challenges, the most formidable of which was a severe economic crisis in 2001-02 that led to violent public protests and the successive resignations of several presidents. The years 2003-15 saw Peronist rule by Nestor and Cristina FERNANDEZ de KIRCHNER, whose policies isolated Argentina and caused economic stagnation. With the election of Mauricio MACRI in November 2015, Argentina began a period of reform and international reintegration.&lt;/p&gt;","Southern South America, bordering the South Atlantic Ocean, between Chile and Uruguay","34 00 S, 64 00 W",South America,"2,780,400 sq km","2,736,690 sq km","43,710 sq km",slightly less than three-tenths the size of the US,"11,968 km","Bolivia 942 km, Brazil 1263 km, Chile 6691 km, Paraguay 2531 km, Uruguay 541 km","4,989 km",12 nm,200 nm,24 nm,200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin,mostly temperate;

Although one of the world&#39;s wealthiest countries 100 years ago, Argentina suffered during most of the 20th century from recurring economic crises, persistent fiscal and current account deficits, high inflation, mounting external debt, and capital flight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cristina FERNANDEZ DE KIRCHNER succeeded her husband as president in late 2007, and in 2008 the rapid economic growth of previous years slowed sharply as government policies held back exports and the world economy fell into recession. In 2010 the economy rebounded strongly, but slowed in late 2011 even as the government continued to rely on expansionary fiscal and monetary policies, which kept inflation in the double digits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to deal with these problems, the government expanded state intervention in the economy: it nationalized the oil company YPF from Spain&#39;s Repsol, expanded measures to restrict imports, and further tightened currency controls in an effort to bolster foreign reserves and stem capital flight. Between 2011 and 2013, Central Bank foreign reserves dropped $21.3 billion from a high of $52.7 billion. In July 2014, Argentina and China agreed on an $11 billion currency swap; the Argentine Central Bank has received the equivalent of $3.2 billion in Chinese yuan, which it counts as international reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the election of President Mauricio MACRI in November 2015, Argentina began a historic political and economic transformation, as his administration took steps to liberalize the Argentine economy, lifting capital controls, floating the peso, removing export controls on some commodities, cutting some energy subsidies, and reforming the countryâ€™s official statistics. Argentina negotiated debt payments with holdout bond creditors, continued working with the IMF to shore up its finances, and returned to international capital markets in April 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Argentinaâ€™s economy emerged from recession with GDP growth of nearly 3.0%.

Argentina&#39;s fertility decline began earlier than in the rest of Latin America, occurring most rapidly between the early 20th century and the 1950s, and then becoming more gradual. Life expectancy has been improving, most notably among the young and the poor. While the population under age 15 is shrinking, the youth cohort - ages 15-24 - is the largest in Argentina&#39;s history and will continue to bolster the working-age population. If this large working-age population is well-educated and gainfully employed, Argentina is likely to experience an economic boost and possibly higher per capita savings and investment. Although literacy and primary school enrollment are nearly universal, grade repetition is problematic and secondary school completion is low. Both of these issues vary widely by region and socioeconomic group.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Argentina has been primarily a country of immigration for most of its history, welcoming European immigrants (often providing needed low-skilled labor) after its independence in the 19th century and attracting especially large numbers from Spain and Italy. More than 7 million European immigrants are estimated to have arrived in Argentina between 1880 and 1930, when it adopted a more restrictive immigration policy. European immigration also began to wane in the 1930s because of the global depression. The inflow rebounded temporarily following WWII and resumed its decline in the 1950s when Argentina&#39;s military dictators tightened immigration rules and European economies rebounded. Regional migration increased, however, supplying low-skilled workers escaping economic and political instability in their home countries. As of 2015, immigrants made up almost 5% of Argentina&#39;s population, the largest share in South America. Migration from neighboring countries accounted for approximately 80% of Argentina&#39;s immigrant population in 2015.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first waves of highly skilled Argentine emigrant workers headed mainly to the United States and Spain in the 1960s and 1970s, driven by economic decline and repressive military dictatorships.

Following annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938 and subsequent occupation by the victorious Allies in 1945, Austria&#39;s status remained unclear for a decade. A State Treaty signed in 1955 ended the occupation, recognized Austria&#39;s independence, and forbade unification with Germany. A constitutional law that same year declared the country&#39;s &quot;perpetual neutrality&quot; as a condition for Soviet military withdrawal. The Soviet Union&#39;s collapse in 1991 and Austria&#39;s entry into the EU in 1995 have altered the meaning of this neutrality.

BIH,Bahrain,BA,17-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;In 1783, the Sunni Al-Khalifa family took power in Bahrain. In order to secure these holdings, it entered into a series of treaties with the UK during the 19th century that made Bahrain a British protectorate. The archipelago attained its independence in 1971. A steady decline in oil production and reserves since 1970 prompted Bahrain to take steps to diversify its economy, in the process developing petroleum processing and refining, aluminum production, and hospitality and retail sectors. It has also endeavored to become a leading regional banking center, especially with respect to Islamic finance. Bahrain&#39;s small size, central location among Gulf countries, economic dependence on Saudi Arabia, and proximity to Iran require it to play a delicate balancing act in foreign affairs among its larger neighbors. Its foreign policy activities usually fall in line with Saudi Arabia and the UAE.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Sunni royal family has long struggled to manage relations with its large Shia-majority population. In early 2011, amid Arab uprisings elsewhere in the region, the Bahraini Government confronted similar pro-democracy and reform protests at home with police and military action, including deploying Gulf Cooperation Council security forces to Bahrain. Failed political talks prompted opposition political societies to boycott 2014 legislative and municipal council elections. In 2018, a law preventing members of political societies dissolved by the courts from participating in elections effectively sidelined the majority of opposition figures from taking part in national elections. As a result, most members of parliament are independents. Ongoing dissatisfaction with the political status quo continues to factor into sporadic clashes between demonstrators and security forces.&lt;/p&gt;","Middle East, archipelago in the Persian Gulf, east of Saudi Arabia","26 00 N, 50 33 E",Middle East,760 sq km,760 sq km,0 sq km,"3.5 times the size of Washington, DC",,,161 km,12 nm,,24 nm, extending to boundaries to be determined,"arid;

Despite the Governmentâ€™s past efforts to diversify the economy, oil still comprises 85% of Bahraini budget revenues. In the last few years lower world energy prices have generated sizable budget deficits - about 10% of GDP in 2017 alone. Bahrain has few options for covering these deficits, with low foreign assets and fewer oil resources compared to its GCC neighbors. The three major US credit agencies downgraded Bahrainâ€™s sovereign debt rating to &quot;junk&quot; status in 2016, citing persistently low oil prices and the governmentâ€™s high debt levels. Nevertheless, Bahrain was able to raise about $4 billion by issuing foreign currency denominated debt in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other major economic activities are production of aluminum - Bahrain&#39;s second biggest export after oil and gas â€“finance, and construction. Bahrain continues to seek new natural gas supplies as feedstock to support its expanding petrochemical and aluminum industries. In April 2018 Bahrain announced it had found a significant oil field off the countryâ€™s west coast, but is still assessing how much of the oil can be extracted profitably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to addressing its current fiscal woes, Bahraini authorities face the long-term challenge of boosting Bahrainâ€™s regional competitiveness â€” especially regarding industry, finance, and tourism â€” and reconciling revenue constraints with popular pressure to maintain generous state subsidies and a large public sector. Since 2015, the government lifted subsidies on meat, diesel, kerosene, and gasoline and has begun to phase in higher prices for electricity and water. As part of its diversification plans, Bahrain implemented a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US in August 2006, the first FTA between the US and a Gulf state.

Service and high-tech industries are concentrated in the northern Flanders region while the southern region of Wallonia is home to industries like coal and steel manufacturing. Belgium is completely reliant on foreign sources of fossil fuels, and the planned closure of its seven nuclear plants by 2025 should increase its dependence on foreign energy. Its role as a regional logistical hub makes its economy vulnerable to shifts in foreign demand, particularly with EU trading partners. Roughly three-quarters of Belgium&#39;s trade is with other EU countries, and the port of Zeebrugge conducts almost half its trade with the United Kingdom alone, leaving Belgiumâ€™s economy vulnerable to the outcome of negotiations on the UKâ€™s exit from the EU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belgiumâ€™s GDP grew by 1.7% in 2017 and the budget deficit was 1.5% of GDP. Unemployment stood at 7.3%, however the unemployment rate is lower in Flanders than Wallonia, 4.4% compared to 9.4%, because of industrial differences between the regions. The economy largely recovered from the March 2016 terrorist attacks that mainly impacted the Brussels region tourist and hospitality industry. Prime Minister Charles MICHEL&#39;s center-right government has pledged to further reduce the deficit in response to EU pressure to decrease Belgium&#39;s high public debt of about 104% of GDP, but such efforts would also dampen economic growth. In addition to restrained public spending, low wage growth and higher inflation promise to curtail a more robust recovery in private consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government has pledged to pursue a reform program to improve Belgiumâ€™s competitiveness, including changes to labor market rules and welfare benefits. These changes have generally made Belgian wages more competitive regionally, but have raised tensions with trade unions, which have called for extended strikes. In 2017, Belgium approved a tax reform plan to ease corporate rates from 33% to 29% by 2018 and down to 25% by 2020. The tax plan also included benefits for innovation and SMEs, intended to spur competitiveness and private investment.&lt;/p&gt;",$529.2 billion,$493.7 billion (2017 est.),1.70%,"$46,600 ",24.5% of GDP,51.2% (2017 est.),23.4% (2017 est.),23.3% (2017 est.),1.3% (2017 est.),85.1% (2017 est.),-84.4% (2017 est.),0.7% (2017 est.),22.1% (2017 est.),77.2% (2017 est.),"sugar beets, fresh vegetables, fruits, grain, tobacco;

British settlement of the islands began in 1647; the islands became a colony in 1783. Piracy thrived in the 17th and 18th centuries because of The Bahamas close proximity to shipping lanes. Since attaining independence from the UK in 1973, The Bahamas has prospered through tourism, international banking, and investment management, which comprise up to 85% of GDP. Because of its proximity to the US - the nearest Bahamian landmass being only 80 km (50 mi) from Florida - the country is a major transshipment point for illicit trafficking, particularly to the US mainland, as well as Europe.

BGR,Bangladesh,BG,19-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;The huge delta region formed at the confluence of the Ganges and Brahmaputra River systems - now referred to as Bangladesh - was a loosely incorporated outpost of various empires centered on the Gangetic plain for much of the first millennium A.D. Muslim conversions and settlement in the region began in the 10th century, primarily from Arab and Persian traders and preachers. Europeans established trading posts in the area in the 16th century. Eventually the area known as Bengal, primarily Hindu in the western section and mostly Muslim in the eastern half, became part of British India. Partition in 1947 resulted in an eastern wing of Pakistan in the Muslim-majority area, which became East Pakistan. Calls for greater autonomy and animosity between the eastern and western wings of Pakistan led to a Bengali independence movement. That movement, led by the Awami League (AL) and supported by India, won the independence war for Bangladesh in 1971.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The post-independence AL government faced daunting challenges and in 1975 it was overthrown by the military, triggering a series of military coups that resulted in a military-backed government and subsequent creation of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in 1978. That government also ended in a coup in 1981, followed by military-backed rule until democratic elections occurred in 1991. The BNP and AL have alternated in power since 1991, with the exception of a military-backed, emergency caretaker regime that suspended parliamentary elections planned for January 2007 in an effort to reform the political system and root out corruption. That government returned the country to fully democratic rule in December 2008 with the election of the AL and Prime Minister Sheikh HASINA. In January 2014, the incumbent AL won the national election by an overwhelming majority after the BNP boycotted the election, which extended HASINA&#39;s term as prime minister. In December 2018, HASINA secured a third consecutive term (fourth overall) with the AL coalition securing 96% of available seats, amid widespread claims of election irregularities. With the help of international development assistance, Bangladesh has reduced the poverty rate from over half of the population to less than a third, achieved Millennium Development Goals for maternal and child health, and made great progress in food security since independence. The economy has grown at an annual average of about 6% for the last two decades and the country reached World Bank lower-middle income status in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;","Southern Asia, bordering the Bay of Bengal, between Burma and India","24 00 N, 90 00 E",Asia,"148,460 sq km","130,170 sq km","18,290 sq km",slightly larger than Pennsylvania and New Jersey combined;

BHR,Belize,BH,17-Dec-19,"Belize was the site of several Mayan city states until their decline at the end of the first millennium A.D. The British and Spanish disputed the region in the 17th and 18th centuries; it formally became the colony of British Honduras in 1862.

Guatemala refused to recognize the new nation until 1992 and the two countries are involved in an ongoing border dispute. Both nations have voted to send the dispute for final resolution to the International Court of Justice. Tourism has become the mainstay of the economy.

Belizeans seeking job and educational opportunities have preferred to emigrate to the United States rather than former colonizer Great Britain because of the United States&#39; closer proximity and stronger trade ties with Belize. Belizeans also emigrate to Canada, Mexico, and English-speaking Caribbean countries. The emigration of a large share of Creoles (Afro-Belizeans) and the influx of Central American immigrants, mainly Guatemalans, Salvadorans, and Hondurans, has changed Belize&#39;s ethnic composition. Mestizos have become the largest ethnic group, and Belize now has more native Spanish speakers than English or Creole speakers, despite English being the official language.

BMU,Burma,BM,17-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;Various ethnic Burman and ethnic minority city-states or kingdoms occupied the present borders through the 19th century, and several minority ethnic groups continue to maintain independent armies and control territory within the country today, in opposition to the central government. Over a period of 62 years (1824-1886), Britain conquered Burma and incorporated&amp;nbsp;all the groups within&amp;nbsp;the country into its Indian Empire. Burma was administered as a province of India until 1937 when it became a separate, self-governing colony; in 1948,&amp;nbsp;following major battles on its territory during World War II,&amp;nbsp;Burma attained independence from the British Commonwealth. Gen. NE WIN dominated the government from 1962 to 1988, first as military ruler, then as self-appointed president, and later as political kingpin. In response to widespread civil unrest, NE WIN resigned in 1988, but within months the military crushed student-led protests and took power. Since independence, successive&amp;nbsp;Burmese&amp;nbsp;governments have fought on-and-off conflicts with armed ethnic groups&amp;nbsp;seeking autonomy&amp;nbsp;in the country&amp;rsquo;s mountainous border regions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Multiparty legislative elections in 1990 resulted in the main opposition party - the National League for Democracy (NLD) - winning a landslide victory. Instead of handing over power, the junta placed NLD leader (and 1991 Nobel Peace Prize recipient) AUNG SAN SUU KYI under house arrest from 1989 to 1995, 2000 to 2002, and from May 2003 to November 2010. In late September 2007, the ruling junta brutally suppressed protests over increased fuel prices led by prodemocracy activists and Buddhist monks, killing an unknown number of people and arresting thousands for participating in the demonstrations - popularly referred to as the Saffron Revolution. In early May 2008, Cyclone&amp;nbsp;Nargis&amp;nbsp;struck Burma, which left over 138,000 dead and tens of thousands injured and homeless. Despite this tragedy, the junta proceeded with its May constitutional referendum, the first vote in Burma since 1990. The 2008 constitution reserves 25% of its seats to the military. Legislative elections held in November 2010, which the NLD boycotted and many in the international community considered flawed, saw the successor ruling junta&#39;s mass organization, the Union Solidarity and Development Party garner over 75% of the contested seats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The national legislature convened in January 2011 and selected former Prime Minister THEIN SEIN as president. Although the vast majority of national-level appointees named by THEIN SEIN were former or current military officers, the government initiated a series of political and economic reforms leading to a substantial opening of the long-isolated country. These reforms included releasing hundreds of political prisoners, signing a nationwide cease-fire with several of the country&#39;s ethnic armed groups, pursuing legal reform, and gradually reducing restrictions on freedom of the press, association, and civil society. At least due in part to these reforms, AUNG SAN SUU KYI was elected to the national legislature in April 2012 and became chair of the Committee for Rule of Law and Tranquility. Burma served as chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) for 2014. In a flawed but largely credible national legislative election in November 2015 featuring more than 90 political parties, the NLD again won a landslide victory. Using its overwhelming majority in both houses of parliament, the NLD elected HTIN KYAW, AUNG SAN SUU KYI&amp;rsquo;s confidant and long-time NLD supporter, as president. The new legislature created the position of State Counsellor, according AUNG SAN SUU KYI a formal role in the government and making her the de facto head of state. Burma&#39;s first credibly elected civilian government after more than five decades of military dictatorship was sworn into office on 30 March 2016. In March 2018, upon HTIN KYAW&amp;rsquo;s resignation, parliament selected WIN MYINT, another long-time ally of AUNG SAN SUU KYI&amp;rsquo;s, as president.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Attacks in October 2016 and August 2017 on security forces in northern Rakhine State by members of the&amp;nbsp;Arakan&amp;nbsp;Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), a Rohingya militant group, resulted in military crackdowns on the Rohingya population&amp;nbsp;that reportedly caused thousands of deaths&amp;nbsp;and human rights abuses. Following the August 2017 violence, over 740,000 Rohingya fled&amp;nbsp;to neighboring Bangladesh as refugees. In November 2017, the US Department of State determined that the August 2017 violence constituted ethnic cleansing&amp;nbsp;of Rohingyas. The UN has called for Burma to allow access to a Fact Finding Mission to investigate reports of human rights violations and abuses and to work with Bangladesh to facilitate repatriation of Rohingya refugees, and in September 2018 the International Criminal Court&amp;nbsp;(ICC)&amp;nbsp;determined it had jurisdiction to investigate&amp;nbsp;reported human rights&amp;nbsp;abuses&amp;nbsp;against Rohingyas. Burma&amp;nbsp;has&amp;nbsp;rejected charges of ethnic cleansing&amp;nbsp;and genocide,&amp;nbsp;and has chosen not to work with the UN Fact Finding Mission&amp;nbsp;or the ICC. In March 2018, President HTIN KYAW announced his voluntary retirement; NLD parliamentarian WIN MYINT was named by the parliament as his successor. In February 2019, the NLD announced it would establish a parliamentary committee to examine options for constitutional reform&amp;nbsp;ahead of national the elections planned for 2020.&lt;/p&gt;","Southeastern Asia, bordering the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal, between Bangladesh and Thailand","22 00 N, 98 00 E",Southeast Asia,"676,578 sq km","653,508 sq km","23,070 sq km",slightly smaller than Texas,"6,522 km","Bangladesh 271 km, China 2129 km, India 1468 km, Laos 238 km, Thailand 2416 km","1,930 km",12 nm,200 nm,24 nm,200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin,"tropical monsoon;

Burma established a managed float of the Burmese kyat in 2012, granted the Central Bank operational independence in July 2013, enacted a new anti-corruption law in September 2013, and granted licenses to 13 foreign banks in 2014-16. State Counsellor AUNG SAN SUU KYI and the ruling National League for Democracy, who took power in March 2016, have sought to improve Burmaâ€™s investment climate following the US sanctions lift in October 2016 and reinstatement of Generalized System of Preferences trade benefits in November 2016. In October 2016, Burma passed a foreign investment law that consolidates investment regulations and eases rules on foreign ownership of businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burmaâ€™s economic growth rate recovered from a low growth under 6% in 2011 but has been volatile between 6% and 7.2% during the past few years. Burmaâ€™s abundant natural resources and young labor force have the potential to attract foreign investment in the energy, garment, information technology, and food and beverage sectors. The government is focusing on accelerating agricultural productivity and land reforms, modernizing and opening the financial sector, and developing transportation and electricity infrastructure. The government has also taken steps to improve transparency in the mining and oil sectors through publication of reports under the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in 2016 and 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these improvements, living standards have not improved for the majority of the people residing in rural areas. Burma remains one of the poorest countries in Asia â€“ approximately 26% of the countryâ€™s 51 million people live in poverty. The isolationist policies and economic mismanagement of previous governments have left Burma with poor infrastructure, endemic corruption, underdeveloped human resources, and inadequate access to capital, which will require a major commitment to reverse. The Burmese Government has been slow to address impediments to economic development such as unclear land rights, a restrictive trade licensing system, an opaque revenue collection system, and an antiquated banking system.&lt;/p&gt;",$329.8 billion,$67.28 billion (2017 est.),6.80%,"$6,300 ",17.7% of GDP,59.2% (2017 est.),13.8% (2017 est.),33.5% (2017 est.),1.5% (2017 est.),21.4% (2017 est.),-28.6% (2017 est.),24.1% (2017 est.),35.6% (2017 est.),40.3% (2017 est.),"rice, pulses, beans, sesame, groundnuts;

the government has a written plan that, if implemented, would constitute making a significant effort toward meeting the minimum standard for eliminating human trafficking; in 2014, law enforcement continued to investigate and prosecute cross-border trafficking offenses but did little to address domestic trafficking; no civilians or government officials were prosecuted or convicted for the recruitment of child soldiers, a serious problem that is hampered by corruption and the influence of the military; victim referral and protection services remained inadequate, especially for men, and left victims vulnerable to being re-trafficked;

BRN,Benin,BN,17-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;Present day Benin was the site of Dahomey, a West African kingdom that rose to prominence in about 1600 and over the next two and a half centuries became a regional power, largely based on its slave trade. France began to control the coastal areas of Dahomey in the second half of the 19th century; the entire kingdom was conquered by 1894. French Dahomey achieved independence in 1960; it changed its name to the Republic of Benin in 1975.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A succession of military governments ended in 1972 with the rise to power of Mathieu KEREKOU and the establishment of a government based on Marxist-Leninist principles. A move to representative government began in 1989. Two years later, free elections ushered in former Prime Minister Nicephore SOGLO as president, marking the first successful transfer of power in Africa from a dictatorship to a democracy. KEREKOU was returned to power by elections held in 1996 and 2001, though some irregularities were alleged. KEREKOU stepped down at the end of his second term in 2006 and was succeeded by Thomas YAYI Boni, a political outsider and independent, who won a second five-year term in March 2011. Patrice TALON, a wealthy businessman, took office in 2016 after campaigning to restore public confidence in the government.&lt;/p&gt;","Western Africa, bordering the Bight of Benin, between Nigeria and Togo","9 30 N, 2 15 E",Africa,"112,622 sq km","110,622 sq km","2,000 sq km",slightly smaller than Pennsylvania,"2,123 km","Burkina Faso 386 km, Niger 277 km, Nigeria 809 km, Togo 651 km",121 km,200 nm,,,200 nm,"tropical;

Cotton is a key export commodity, with export earnings significantly impacted by the price of cotton in the broader market. The economy began deflating in 2017, with the consumer price index falling 0.8%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the first two years of President TALONâ€™s administration, which began in April 2016, the government has followed an ambitious action plan to kickstart development through investments in infrastructure, education, agriculture, and governance. Electricity generation, which has constrained Beninâ€™s economic growth, has increased and blackouts have been considerably reduced. Private foreign direct investment is small, and foreign aid accounts for a large proportion of investment in infrastructure projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benin has appealed for international assistance to mitigate piracy against commercial shipping in its territory, and has used equipment from donors effectively against such piracy. Pilferage has significantly dropped at the Port of Cotonou, though the port is still struggling with effective implementation of the International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code. Projects included in Benin&#39;s $307 million Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) first compact (2006-11) were designed to increase investment and private sector activity by improving key institutional and physical infrastructure. The four projects focused on access to land, access to financial services, access to justice, and access to markets (including modernization of the port). The Port of Cotonou is a major contributor to Beninâ€™s economy, with revenues projected to account for more than 40% of Beninâ€™s national budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benin will need further efforts to upgrade infrastructure, stem corruption, and expand access to foreign markets to achieve its potential. In September 2015, Benin signed a second MCC Compact for $375 million that entered into force in June 2017 and is designed to strengthen the national utility service provider, attract private sector investment, fund infrastructure investments in electricity generation and distribution, and develop off-grid electrification for poor and unserved households. As part of the Government of Beninâ€™s action plan to spur growth, Benin passed public private partnership legislation in 2017 to attract more foreign investment, place more emphasis on tourism, facilitate the development of new food processing systems and agricultural products, encourage new information and communication technology, and establish Independent Power Producers. In April 2017, the IMF approved a three year $150.4 million Extended Credit Facility agreement to maintain debt sustainability and boost donor confidence.&lt;/p&gt;",$25.39 billion,$9.246 billion (2017 est.),5.60%,"$2,300 ",17.3% of GDP,70.5% (2017 est.),13.1% (2017 est.),27.6% (2017 est.),0% (2017 est.),31.6% (2017 est.),-43% (2017 est.),26.1% (2017 est.),22.8% (2017 est.),51.1% (2017 est.),"cotton, corn, cassava (manioc, tapioca), yams, beans, palm oil, peanuts, cashews; livestock","textiles, food processing, construction materials, cement",3% (2017 est.),3.662 million (2007 est.),,,,1%,36.2% (2011 est.),3.10%,29% (2003),1.578 billion (2017 est.),2.152 billion (2017 est.),17.1% (of GDP) (2017 est.),-6.2% (of GDP) (2017 est.),54.6% of GDP,calendar year,0.10%,4.25%,5.30%,$2.189 billion,$2.189 billion,$1.553 billion,&lt;p&gt;NA&lt;/p&gt;,-$1.024 billion,$1.974 billion,"Bangladesh 18.1%, India 10.7%, Ukraine 9%, Niger 8.1%, China 7.7%, Nigeria 7.2%, Turkey 4% (2017)","cotton, cashews, shea butter, textiles, palm products, seafood",$2.787 billion,"foodstuffs, capital goods, petroleum products","Thailand 18.1%, India 15.9%, France 8.5%, China 7.5%, Togo 5.9%, Netherlands 4.3%, Belgium 4.3% (2017)",$57.5 million,$2.476 billion,,,Communaute Financiere Africaine francs (XOF) per US dollar -,,335 million kWh (2016 est.),1.143 billion kWh (2016 est.),0 kWh (2016 est.),1.088 billion kWh (2016 est.),"321,000 kW (2016 est.)",88% of total installed capacity (2016 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),9% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),2% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),0 bbl/day (2018 est.),0 bbl/day (2015 est.),0 bbl/day (2015 est.),8 million bbl (1 January 2018 est.),0 bbl/day (2015 est.),"38,000 bbl/day (2016 est.)","1,514 bbl/day (2015 est.)","38,040 bbl/day (2015 est.)",0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),1.133 billion cu m (1 January 2018 est.),5.664 million Mt (2017 est.),"56,787",1 (2017 est.),"8,773,044",79 (2017 est.),"fixed-line network characterized by aging, deteriorating equipment; mobile networks account for almost all Internet connections; govt. aims to provide telecoms services to 80% of the country, mostly via mobile infrastructure; govt aims to&amp;nbsp;restructure state-owned telcos and has partially done so; Mobile Number Portability (MNP) is available; Benin joins free roaming scheme (2018)","fixed-line teledensity only about 1 per 100 persons; spurred by the presence of multiple mobile-cellular providers, cellular telephone subscribership has increased rapidly, exceeding&amp;nbsp;79 per 100 persons in 2017 (2018)","country code - 229; landing points for the SAT-3/WASC and ACE fiber-optic submarine cable that provides connectivity to Europe, and&amp;nbsp;most West African countries; satellite earth stations - 7 (Intelsat-Atlantic Ocean) (2019)","state-run Office de Radiodiffusion et de Television du Benin (ORTB) operates a TV station providing a wide broadcast reach; several privately owned TV stations broadcast from Cotonou; satellite TV subscription service is available; state-owned radio, under ORTB control, includes a national station supplemented by a number of regional stations; substantial number of privately owned radio broadcast stations; transmissions of a few international broadcasters are available on FM in Cotonou (2019)",.bj,"1,288,336",12% (July 2016 est.),"28,833", less than 1 (2017 est.),0.86% of GDP,"Benin Armed Forces (Forces Armees Beninoises, FAB): Army, Navy, Air Force; Ministry of Public Security: Republican Police (2019)",18-35 years of age for selective compulsory and voluntary military service; a higher education diploma is required; both sexes are eligible for military service; conscript tour of duty - 18 months (2013),1 (2015),1 (2015),"112,392 (2015)","805,347 mt-km (2015)",TY (2016),6 (2013),1 (2017),,,1 (2017),,,5 (2013),,2 (2013),1 (2013),2 (2013),,,134 km gas,"16,000 km (2006)","1,400 km (2006)",6,other 6 (2018),Cotonou,,,&lt;p&gt;talks continue between Benin and Togo on funding the Adjrala hydroelectric dam on the Mona River; Benin retains a border dispute with Burkina Faso near the town of Koualou; location of Benin-Niger-Nigeria tripoint is unresolved&lt;/p&gt;,transshipment point used by traffickers for cocaine destined for Western Europe; vulnerable to money laundering due to poorly enforced financial regulations,20.4 years (2017/18 est.),15.5% (2017/18),very high (2019),"bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever (2019)",dengue fever and&amp;nbsp;malaria (2019),16.8% (2018),,36.5,,8 million (2017),41.4% (2016),70.8% (2016),18% (2016),,"14,600 km (2006)",150 km (seasonal navigation on River Niger along northern border) (2011),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,200 nm,"&lt;p&gt;Benin has a youthful age structure â€“ almost 65% of the population is under the age of 25 â€“ which is bolstered by high fertility and population growth rates.

The countryâ€™s agricultural base is largely dependent on government subsidies. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, an initial burst of economic reforms included privatization of state enterprises, creation of private property rights, and the acceptance of private entrepreneurship, but by 1994 the reform effort dissipated. About 80% of industry remains in state hands, and foreign investment has virtually disappeared. Several businesses have been renationalized. State-owned entities account for 70-75% of GDP, and state banks make up 75% of the banking sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economic output declined for several years following the break-up of the Soviet Union, but revived in the mid-2000s. Belarus has only small reserves of crude oil and imports crude oil and natural gas from Russia at subsidized, below market, prices. Belarus derives export revenue by refining Russian crude and selling it at market prices. Russia and Belarus have had serious disagreements over prices and quantities for Russian energy. Beginning in early 2016, Russia claimed Belarus began accumulating debt â€“ reaching $740 million by April 2017 â€“ for paying below the agreed price for Russian natural gas and Russia cut back its export of crude oil as a result of the debt. In April 2017, Belarus agreed to pay its gas debt and Russia restored the flow of crude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New non-Russian foreign investment has been limited in recent years, largely because of an unfavorable financial climate. In 2011, a financial crisis lead to a nearly three-fold devaluation of the Belarusian ruble. The Belarusian economy has continued to struggle under the weight of high external debt servicing payments and a trade deficit. In mid-December 2014, the devaluation of the Russian ruble triggered a near 40% devaluation of the Belarusian ruble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belarusâ€™s economy stagnated between 2012 and 2016, widening productivity and income gaps between Belarus and neighboring countries. Budget revenues dropped because of falling global prices on key Belarusian export commodities. Since 2015, the Belarusian government has tightened its macro-economic policies, allowed more flexibility to its exchange rate, taken some steps towards price liberalization, and reduced subsidized government lending to state-owned enterprises. Belarus returned to modest growth in 2017, largely driven by improvement of external conditions and Belarus issued sovereign debt for the first time since 2011, which provided the country with badly-needed liquidity, and issued $600 million worth of Eurobonds in February 2018, predominantly to US and British investors.&lt;/p&gt;",$179.4 billion,$54.44 billion (2017 est.),2.40%,"$18,900 ",24.5% of GDP,54.8% (2017 est.),14.6% (2017 est.),24.9% (2017 est.),5.7% (2017 est.),67% (2017 est.),-67% (2017 est.),8.1% (2017 est.),40.8% (2017 est.),51.1% (2017 est.),"grain, potatoes, vegetables, sugar beets, flax;

BRA,Brazil,BR,17-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;Following more than three centuries under Portuguese rule, Brazil gained its independence in 1822, maintaining a monarchical system of government until the abolition of slavery in 1888 and the subsequent proclamation of a republic by the military in 1889. Brazilian coffee exporters politically dominated the country until populist leader Getulio VARGAS rose to power in 1930. By far the largest and most populous country in South America, Brazil underwent more than a half century of populist and military government until 1985, when the military regime peacefully ceded power to civilian rulers. Brazil continues to pursue industrial and agricultural growth and development of its interior. Having successfully weathered a period of global financial difficulty in the late 20th century, Brazil was seen as one of the world&#39;s strongest emerging markets and a contributor to global growth. The awarding of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2016 Summer Olympic Games, the first ever to be held in South America, was seen as symbolic of the country&#39;s rise. However, from about 2013 to 2016, Brazil was plagued by a sagging economy, high unemployment, and high inflation, only emerging from recession in 2017. Former President Dilma ROUSSEFF (2011-2016) was removed from office in 2016 by Congress for having committed impeachable acts against Brazil&#39;s budgetary laws, and her vice president, Michel TEMER, served the remainder of her second term.

In 2017, Brazil`s GDP grew 1%, inflation fell to historic lows of 2.9%, and the Central Bank lowered benchmark interest rates from 13.75% in 2016 to 7%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economy has been negatively affected by multiple corruption scandals involving private companies and government officials, including the impeachment and conviction of Former President Dilma ROUSSEFF in August 2016. Sanctions against the firms involved â€” some of the largest in Brazil â€” have limited their business opportunities, producing a ripple effect on associated businesses and contractors but creating opportunities for foreign companies to step into what had been a closed market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The succeeding TEMER administration has implemented a series of fiscal and structural reforms to restore credibility to government finances. Congress approved legislation in December 2016 to cap public spending. Government spending growth had pushed public debt to 73.7% of GDP at the end of 2017, up from over 50% in 2012. The government also boosted infrastructure projects, such as oil and natural gas auctions, in part to raise revenues. Other economic reforms, proposed in 2016, aim to reduce barriers to foreign investment, and to improve labor conditions. Policies to strengthen Brazilâ€™s workforce and industrial sector, such as local content requirements, have boosted employment, but at the expense of investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil is a member of the Common Market of the South (Mercosur), a trade bloc that includes Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay - Venezuelaâ€™s membership in the organization was suspended In August 2017.

Brasilia has not taken full advantage of its large working-age population to develop its human capital and strengthen its social and economic institutions but is funding a study abroad program to bring advanced skills back to the country. The current favorable age structure will begin to shift around 2025, with the labor force shrinking and the elderly starting to compose an increasing share of the total population. Well-funded public pensions have nearly wiped out poverty among the elderly, and Bolsa Familia and other social programs have lifted tens of millions out of poverty. More than half of Brazil&#39;s population is considered middle class, but poverty and income inequality levels remain high; the Northeast, North, and Center-West, women, and black, mixed race, and indigenous populations are disproportionately affected. Disparities in opportunities foster social exclusion and contribute to Brazil&#39;s high crime rate, particularly violent crime in cities and favelas (slums).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil has traditionally been a net recipient of immigrants, with its southeast being the prime destination. After the importation of African slaves was outlawed in the mid-19th century, Brazil sought Europeans (Italians, Portuguese, Spaniards, and Germans) and later Asians (Japanese) to work in agriculture, especially coffee cultivation. Recent immigrants come mainly from Argentina, Chile, and Andean countries (many are unskilled illegal migrants) or are returning Brazilian nationals. Since Brazil&#39;s economic downturn in the 1980s, emigration to the United States, Europe, and Japan has been rising but is negligible relative to Brazil&#39;s total population.

Burundi gained its independence from Belgium in 1962 as the Kingdom of Burundi, but the monarchy was overthrown in 1966 and a republic established. Political violence and non-democratic transfers of power have marked much of its history; Burundi&#39;s first democratically elected president, a Hutu, was assassinated in October 1993 after only 100 days in office. The internationally brokered Arusha Agreement, signed in 2000, and subsequent ceasefire agreements with armed movements ended the 1993-2005 civil war. Burundi&amp;rsquo;s second democratic elections were held in 2005. Pierre NKURUNZIZA was elected president in 2005 and 2010, and again in a controversial election in 2015.

Agriculture accounts for over 40% of GDP and employs more than 90% of the population.

Foreign aid represented 48% of Burundi&#39;s national income in 2015, one of the highest percentages in Sub-Saharan Africa, but this figure decreased to 33.5% in 2016 due to political turmoil surrounding President NKURUNZIZAâ€™s bid for a third term.

About 90% of the population relies on subsistence agriculture. Subdivision of land to sons, and redistribution to returning refugees, results in smaller, overworked, and less productive plots. Food shortages, poverty, and a lack of clean water contribute to a 60% chronic malnutrition rate among children. A lack of reproductive health services has prevented a significant reduction in Burundiâ€™s maternal mortality and fertility rates, which are both among the worldâ€™s highest.

In the last decade, more than a half million Burundian refugees returned home from neighboring countries, mainly Tanzania. Reintegrating the returnees has been problematic due to their prolonged time in exile, land scarcity, poor infrastructure, poverty, and unemployment. Repatriates and existing residents (including internally displaced persons) compete for limited land and other resources. To further complicate matters, international aid organizations reduced their assistance because they no longer classified Burundi as a post-conflict country. Conditions have deteriorated since renewed violence erupted in April 2015, causing another outpouring of refugees. In addition to refugee out-migration, Burundi has hosted thousands of refugees from neighboring countries, mostly from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and lesser numbers from Rwanda.&lt;/p&gt;",,,,,,,,"Burundi is a source country for children and possibly women subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking; business people recruit Burundian girls for prostitution domestically, as well as in Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda, and the Middle East, and recruit boys and girls for forced labor in Burundi and Tanzania; children and young adults are coerced into forced labor in farming, mining, informal commerce, fishing, or collecting river stones for construction; sometimes family, friends, and neighbors are complicit in exploiting children, at times luring them in with offers of educational or job opportunities","Tier 3 â€“ Burundi does not comply fully with the minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so; corruption, a lack of political will, and limited resources continue to hamper efforts to combat human trafficking; in 2014, the government did not inform judicial and law enforcement officials of the enactment of an anti-trafficking law or how to implement it and approved â€“ but did not fund â€“ its national anti-trafficking action plan; authorities again failed to identify trafficking victims or to provide them with adequate protective services; the government has focused on transnational child trafficking but gave little attention to its domestic child trafficking problem and adult trafficking victims (2015)",,none (landlocked),,974 (2018),schistosomiasis (2019),rabies (2019),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since World War II, the impressive growth of the manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy into one primarily industrial and urban. Canada has a large oil and natural gas sector with the majority of crude oil production derived from oil sands in the western provinces, especially Alberta. Canada now ranks third in the world in proved oil reserves behind Venezuela and Saudi Arabia and is the worldâ€™s seventh-largest oil producer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TThe 1989 Canada-US Free Trade Agreement and the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (which includes Mexico) dramatically increased trade and economic integration between the US and Canada. Canada and the US enjoy the worldâ€™s most comprehensive bilateral trade and investment relationship, with goods and services trade totaling more than $680 billion in 2017, and two-way investment stocks of more than $800 billion. Over three-fourths of Canadaâ€™s merchandise exports are destined for the US each year. Canada is the largest foreign supplier of energy to the US, including oil, natural gas, and electric power, and a top source of US uranium imports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given its abundant natural resources, highly skilled labor force, and modern capital stock, Canada enjoyed solid economic growth from 1993 through 2007. The global economic crisis of 2007-08 moved the Canadian economy into sharp recession by late 2008, and Ottawa posted its first fiscal deficit in 2009 after 12 years of surplus. Canada&#39;s major banks emerged from the financial crisis of 2008-09 among the strongest in the world, owing to the financial sector&#39;s tradition of conservative lending practices and strong capitalization.

COD,Chad,CD,17-Dec-19,"Chad, part of France&#39;s African holdings until 1960, endured three decades of civil warfare, as well as invasions by Libya, before peace was restored in 1990. The government eventually drafted a democratic constitution and held flawed presidential elections in 1996 and 2001. In 1998, a rebellion broke out in northern Chad, which has sporadically flared up despite several peace agreements between the government and insurgents. In June 2005, President Idriss DEBY held a referendum successfully removing constitutional term limits and won another controversial election in 2006. Sporadic rebel campaigns continued throughout 2006 and 2007. The capital experienced a significant insurrection in early 2008, but has had no significant rebel threats since then, in part due to Chad&#39;s 2010 rapprochement with Sudan, which previously used Chadian rebels as proxies. Nevertheless, a state of emergency continues to be in place in the Sila and Ouaddai regions bordering Sudan.&amp;nbsp; In late 2015, the government imposed a state of emergency in the Lake Chad region following multiple attacks by the terrorist group Boko Haram throughout the year; Boko Haram also launched several bombings in N&#39;Djamena in mid-2015. A state of emergency is also emplaced in the western Tibesti region bordering Niger where rival ethnic groups are fighting. DEBY in 2016 was reelected to his fifth term in an election that was peaceful but flawed. In December 2015, Chad completed a two-year rotation on the UN Security Council. In January 2017, DEBY completed a one-year term as&amp;nbsp;Chairperson of the African Union Assembly.

Oil and agriculture are mainstays of Chadâ€™s economy. Oil provides about 60% of export revenues, while cotton, cattle, livestock, and gum arabic provide the bulk of Chad&#39;s non-oil export earnings. The services sector contributes less than one-third of GDP and has attracted foreign investment mostly through telecommunications and banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly all of Chadâ€™s fuel is provided by one domestic refinery, and unanticipated shutdowns occasionally result in shortages. The country regulates the price of domestic fuel, providing an incentive for black market sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although high oil prices and strong local harvests supported the economy in the past, low oil prices now stress Chadâ€™s fiscal position and have resulted in significant government cutbacks. Chad relies on foreign assistance and foreign capital for most of its public and private sector investment. Investment in Chad is difficult due to its limited infrastructure, lack of trained workers, extensive government bureaucracy, and corruption. Chad obtained a three-year extended credit facility from the IMF in 2014 and was granted debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative in April 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2018, economic policy will be driven by efforts that started in 2016 to reverse the recession and to repair damage to public finances and exports. The government is implementing an emergency action plan to counterbalance the drop in oil revenue and to diversify the economy. Chadâ€™s national development plan (NDP) cost just over $9 billion with a financing gap of $6.7 billion. The NDP emphasized the importance of private sector participation in Chadâ€™s development, as well as the need to improve the business environment, particularly in priority sectors such as mining and agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government of Chad reached a deal with Glencore and four other banks on the restructuring of a $1.45 billion oil-backed loan in February 2018, after a long negotiation. The new terms include an extension of the maturity to 2030 from 2022, a two-year grace period on principal repayments, and a lower interest rate of the London Inter-bank Offer Rate (Libor) plus 2% - down from Libor plus 7.5%. The original Glencore loan was to be repaid with crude oil assets, however, Chad&#39;s oil sales were hit by the downturn in the price of oil. Chad had secured a $312 million credit from the IMF in June 2017, but release of those funds hinged on restructuring the Glencore debt. Chad had already cut public spending to try to meet the terms of the IMF program, but that prompted strikes and protests in a country where nearly 40% of the population lives below the poverty line. Multinational partners, such as the African Development Bank, the EU, and the World Bank are likely to continue budget support in 2018, but Chad will remain at high debt risk, given its dependence on oil revenue and pressure to spend on subsidies and security.&lt;/p&gt;",$28.62 billion,$9.872 billion (2017 est.),-3.10%,"$2,300 ",15.5% of GDP,75.1% (2017 est.),4.4% (2017 est.),24.1% (2017 est.),0.7% (2017 est.),35.1% (2017 est.),-39.4% (2017 est.),52.3% (2017 est.),14.7% (2017 est.),33.1% (2017 est.),"cotton, sorghum, millet, peanuts, sesame, corn, rice, potatoes, onions, cassava (manioc, tapioca), cattle, sheep, goats, camels","oil, cotton textiles, brewing, natron (sodium carbonate), soap, cigarettes, construction materials",-4% (2017 est.),5.654 million (2017 est.),80%,20% (2006 est.),,&lt;p&gt;NA&lt;/p&gt;,46.7% (2011 est.),2.60%,30.8% (2003),1.337 billion (2017 est.),1.481 billion (2017 est.),13.5% (of GDP) (2017 est.),-1.5% (of GDP) (2017 est.),52.5% of GDP,calendar year,-0.90%,4.75%,15.50%,$1.241 billion,$1.241 billion,$2.387 billion,&lt;p&gt;NA&lt;/p&gt;,-$558 million,$2.464 billion,"US 38.7%, China 16.6%, Netherlands 15.7%, UAE 12.2%, India 6.3% (2017)","oil, livestock, cotton, sesame, gum arabic, shea butter",$2.16 billion,"machinery and transportation equipment, industrial goods, foodstuffs, textiles","China 19.9%, Cameroon 17.2%, France 17%, US 5.4%, India 4.9%, Senegal 4.5% (2017)",$20.92 million,$1.281 billion,$4.5 billion,&lt;p&gt;NA&lt;/p&gt;,Cooperation Financiere en Afrique Centrale francs (XAF) per US dollar -,,224.3 million kWh (2016 est.),208.6 million kWh (2016 est.),0 kWh (2016 est.),0 kWh (2016 est.),"48,200 kW (2016 est.)",98% of total installed capacity (2016 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),3% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),"132,000 bbl/day (2018 est.)","70,440 bbl/day (2015 est.)",0 bbl/day (2015 est.),1.5 billion bbl (1 January 2018 est.),0 bbl/day (2015 est.),"2,300 bbl/day (2016 est.)",0 bbl/day (2015 est.),"2,285 bbl/day (2015 est.)",0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (1 January 2014 est.),"342,200 Mt (2017 est.)","14,000", less than 1 (July 2016 est.),"6,231,009",52 (July 2016 est.),"inadequate system of radio telephone communication stations with high maintenance costs and low telephone density;

A quarter century of experimentation with Marxism was abandoned in 1990 and a democratically elected government took office in 1992. A two-year civil war that ended in 1999 restored former Marxist President Denis SASSOU-Nguesso, who had ruled from 1979 to 1992, and sparked a short period of ethnic and political unrest that was resolved by a peace agreement in late 1999. A new constitution adopted three years later provided for a multi-party system and a seven-year presidential term, and elections arranged shortly thereafter installed SASSOU-Nguesso. Following a year of renewed fighting, President SASSOU-Nguesso and southern-based rebel groups agreed to a final peace accord in March 2003. SASSOU-Nguesso was reeelected in 2009 and, after passing a referendum allowing him to run for a third term, was reelected again in 2016.

Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the economy, providing a major share of government revenues and exports. Natural gas is increasingly being converted to electricity rather than being flared, greatly improving energy prospects. New mining projects, particularly iron ore, which entered production in late 2013, may add as much as $1 billion to annual government revenue. The Republic of the Congo is a member of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) and shares a common currency â€“ the Central African Franc â€“ with five other member states in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current administration faces difficult economic challenges of stimulating recovery and reducing poverty. The drop in oil prices that began in 2014 has constrained government spending; lower oil prices forced the government to cut more than $1 billion in planned spending. The fiscal deficit amounted to 11% of GDP in 2017. The governmentâ€™s inability to pay civil servant salaries has resulted in multiple rounds of strikes by many groups, including doctors, nurses, and teachers. In the wake of a multi-year recession, the country reached out to the IMF in 2017 for a new program; the IMF noted that the countryâ€™s continued dependence on oil, unsustainable debt, and significant governance weakness are key impediments to the countryâ€™s economy. In 2018, the countryâ€™s external debt level will approach 120% of GDP. The IMF urged the government to renegotiate debts levels to sustainable levels before it agreed to a new macroeconomic adjustment package.&lt;/p&gt;",$29.39 billion,$8.718 billion (2017 est.),-3.10%,"$6,800 ",19.5% of GDP,47.6% (2017 est.),9.6% (2017 est.),42.5% (2017 est.),0.1% (2017 est.),62.9% (2017 est.),-62.7% (2017 est.),9.3% (2017 est.),51% (2017 est.),39.7% (2017 est.),"cassava (manioc, tapioca), sugar, rice, corn, peanuts, vegetables, coffee, cocoa;

COG,"Congo, Democratic Republic of the",CG,17-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;Established as an official Belgian colony in 1908, the then-Republic of the Congo gained its independence in 1960, but its early years were marred by political and social instability. Col. Joseph MOBUTU seized power and declared himself president in a November 1965 coup. He subsequently changed his name - to MOBUTU Sese Seko - as well as that of the country - to Zaire. MOBUTU retained his position for 32 years through several sham elections, as well as through brutal force. Ethnic strife and civil war, touched off by a massive inflow of refugees in 1994 from conflict in Rwanda and Burundi, led in May 1997 to the toppling of the MOBUTU regime by a rebellion backed by Rwanda and Uganda and fronted by Laurent KABILA. KABILA renamed the country the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), but in August 1998 his regime was itself challenged by a second insurrection again backed by Rwanda and Uganda. Troops from Angola, Chad, Namibia, Sudan, and Zimbabwe intervened to support KABILA&#39;s regime. In January 2001, KABILA was assassinated and his son, Joseph KABILA, was named head of state. In October 2002, the new president was successful in negotiating the withdrawal of Rwandan forces occupying the eastern DRC; two months later, the Pretoria Accord was signed by all remaining warring parties to end the fighting and establish a government of national unity. Presidential, National Assembly, and provincial legislatures took place in 2006, with Joseph KABILA elected to office.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;National elections were held in November 2011 and disputed results allowed Joseph KABILA to be reelected to the presidency. While the DRC constitution barred President KABILA from running for a third term, the DRC Government delayed national elections originally slated for November 2016, to 30 December 2018. This failure to hold elections as scheduled fueled significant civil and political unrest, with sporadic street protests by KABILA&amp;rsquo;s opponents and exacerbation of tensions in the tumultuous eastern DRC regions. Presidential, legislative, and provincial elections were held in late December 2018 and early 2019 across most of the country. The DRC Government canceled presidential elections in the cities of Beni and Butembo (citing concerns over an ongoing Ebola outbreak in the region) as well as Yumbi (which had recently experienced heavy violence).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Opposition candidate Felix TSHISEKEDI was announced the election winner on 10 January 2019 and inaugurated two weeks later. This was the first transfer of power to an opposition candidate without significant violence or a coup since the DRC&#39;s independence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The DRC, particularly in the East, continues to experience violence perpetrated by over 100 armed groups active in the region, including the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), and assorted Mai Mai militias.

Systemic corruption since independence in 1960, combined with countrywide instability and intermittent conflict that began in the early-90s, has reduced national output and government revenue, and increased external debt. With the installation of a transitional government in 2003 after peace accords, economic conditions slowly began to improve as the government reopened relations with international financial institutions and international donors, and President KABILA began implementing reforms. Progress on implementing substantive economic reforms remains slow because of political instability, bureaucratic inefficiency, corruption, and patronage, which also dampen international investment prospects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renewed activity in the mining sector, the source of most export income, boosted Kinshasa&#39;s fiscal position and GDP growth until 2015, but low commodity prices have led to slower growth, volatile inflation, currency depreciation, and a growing fiscal deficit.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the country was beset by civil unrest, major famines, military defeats, and foreign occupation. After World War II, the Chinese Communist Party under MAO Zedong established an autocratic socialist system that, while ensuring China&#39;s sovereignty, imposed strict controls over everyday life and cost the lives of tens of millions of people. After 1978, MAO&#39;s successor DENG Xiaoping and other leaders focused on market-oriented economic development and by 2000 output had quadrupled. For much of the population, living standards have improved dramatically but political controls remain tight.

national colors: red, yellow",&quot;Yiyongjun Jinxingqu&quot; (The March of the Volunteers),TIAN Han/NIE Er,"&lt;p&gt;Since the late 1970s, China has moved from a closed, centrally planned system to a more market-oriented one that plays a major global role. China has implemented reforms in a gradualist fashion, resulting in efficiency gains that have contributed to a more than tenfold increase in GDP since 1978. Reforms began with the phaseout of collectivized agriculture, and expanded to include the gradual liberalization of prices, fiscal decentralization, increased autonomy for state enterprises, growth of the private sector, development of stock markets and a modern banking system, and opening to foreign trade and investment. China continues to pursue an industrial policy, state support of key sectors, and a restrictive investment regime. From 2013 to 2017, China had one of the fastest growing economies in the world, averaging slightly more than 7% real growth per year. Measured on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis that adjusts for price differences, China in 2017 stood as the largest economy in the world, surpassing the US in 2014 for the first time in modern history. China became the world&#39;s largest exporter in 2010, and the largest trading nation in 2013. Still, China&#39;s per capita income is below the world average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 2005 moved to an exchange rate system that references a basket of currencies. From mid-2005 to late 2008, the renminbi (RMB) appreciated more than 20% against the US dollar, but the exchange rate remained virtually pegged to the dollar from the onset of the global financial crisis until June 2010, when Beijing announced it would resume a gradual appreciation. From 2013 until early 2015, the renminbi held steady against the dollar, but it depreciated 13% from mid-2015 until end-2016 amid strong capital outflows; in 2017 the RMB resumed appreciating against the dollar â€“ roughly 7% from end-of-2016 to end-of-2017. In 2015, the Peopleâ€™s Bank of China announced it would continue to carefully push for full convertibility of the renminbi, after the currency was accepted as part of the IMFâ€™s special drawing rights basket. However, since late 2015 the Chinese Government has strengthened capital controls and oversight of overseas investments to better manage the exchange rate and maintain financial stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese Government faces numerous economic challenges including: (a) reducing its high domestic savings rate and correspondingly low domestic household consumption; (b) managing its high corporate debt burden to maintain financial stability; (c) controlling off-balance sheet local government debt used to finance infrastructure stimulus; (d) facilitating higher-wage job opportunities for the aspiring middle class, including rural migrants and college graduates, while maintaining competitiveness; (e) dampening speculative investment in the real estate sector without sharply slowing the economy; (f) reducing industrial overcapacity; and (g) raising productivity growth rates through the more efficient allocation of capital and state-support for innovation. Economic development has progressed further in coastal provinces than in the interior, and by 2016 more than 169.3 million migrant workers and their dependents had relocated to urban areas to find work. One consequence of Chinaâ€™s population control policy known as the &quot;one-child policy&quot; - which was relaxed in 2016 to permit all families to have two children - is that China is now one of the most rapidly aging countries in the world. Deterioration in the environment - notably air pollution, soil erosion, and the steady fall of the water table, especially in the North - is another long-term problem. China continues to lose arable land because of erosion and urbanization. The Chinese Government is seeking to add energy production capacity from sources other than coal and oil, focusing on natural gas, nuclear, and clean energy development. In 2016, China ratified the Paris Agreement, a multilateral agreement to combat climate change, and committed to peak its carbon dioxide emissions between 2025 and 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government&#39;s 13th Five-Year Plan, unveiled in March 2016, emphasizes the need to increase innovation and boost domestic consumption to make the economy less dependent on government investment, exports, and heavy industry. However, China has made more progress on subsidizing innovation than rebalancing the economy. Beijing has committed to giving the market a more decisive role in allocating resources, but the Chinese Governmentâ€™s policies continue to favor state-owned enterprises and emphasize stability. Chinese leaders in 2010 pledged to double Chinaâ€™s GDP by 2020, and the 13th Five Year Plan includes annual economic growth targets of at least 6.5% through 2020 to achieve that goal. In recent years, China has renewed its support for state-owned enterprises in sectors considered important to &quot;economic security,&quot; explicitly looking to foster globally competitive industries. Chinese leaders also have undermined some market-oriented reforms by reaffirming the &quot;dominant&quot; role of the state in the economy, a stance that threatens to discourage private initiative and make the economy less efficient over time. The slight acceleration in economic growth in 2017â€”the first such uptick since 2010â€”gives Beijing more latitude to pursue its economic reforms, focusing on financial sector deleveraging and its Supply-Side Structural Reform agenda, first announced in late 2015.&lt;/p&gt;",$25.36 trillion,$12.01 trillion (2017 est.),6.90%,"$18,200 ",45.8% of GDP,39.1% (2017 est.),14.5% (2017 est.),42.7% (2017 est.),1.7% (2017 est.),20.4% (2017 est.),-18.4% (2017 est.),7.9% (2017 est.),40.5% (2017 est.),51.6% (2017 est.),"world leader in gross value of agricultural output;

In the War of the Pacific (1879-83), Chile defeated Peru and Bolivia to win its present northern regions. In the 1880s, the Chilean central government gained control over the central and southern regions inhabited by the Mapuche. After a series of elected governments, the three-year-old Marxist government of Salvador ALLENDE was overthrown in 1973 by a military coup led by General Augusto PINOCHET, who ruled until a democratically-elected president was inaugurated in 1990. Economic reforms, maintained consistently since the 1980s, contributed to steady growth, reduced poverty rates by over half, and helped secure the country&#39;s commitment to democratic and representative government. Chile has increasingly assumed regional and international leadership roles befitting its status as a stable, democratic nation.","Southern South America, bordering the South Pacific Ocean, between Argentina and Peru","30 00 S, 71 00 W",South America,"756,102 sq km","743,812 sq km","12,290 sq km",slightly smaller than twice the size of Montana,"7,801 km","Argentina 6691 km, Bolivia 942 km, Peru 168 km","6,435 km",12 nm,200 nm,24 nm, 200/350 nm,temperate;

Exports of goods and services account for approximately one-third of GDP, with commodities making up some 60% of total exports. Copper is Chileâ€™s top export and provides 20% of government revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 2003 through 2013, real growth averaged almost 5% per year, despite a slight contraction in 2009 that resulted from the global financial crisis. Growth slowed to an estimated 1.4% in 2017. A continued drop in copper prices prompted Chile to experience its third consecutive year of slow growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chile deepened its longstanding commitment to trade liberalization with the signing of a free trade agreement with the US, effective 1 January 2004. Chile has 26 trade agreements covering 60 countries including agreements with the EU, Mercosur, China, India, South Korea, and Mexico. In May 2010, Chile signed the OECD Convention, becoming the first South American country to join the OECD. In October 2015, Chile signed the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, which was finalized as the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and signed at a ceremony in Chile in March 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chilean Government has generally followed a countercyclical fiscal policy, under which it accumulates surpluses in sovereign wealth funds during periods of high copper prices and economic growth, and generally allows deficit spending only during periods of low copper prices and growth. As of 31 October 2016, those sovereign wealth funds - kept mostly outside the country and separate from Central Bank reserves - amounted to more than $23.5 billion. Chile used these funds to finance fiscal stimulus packages during the 2009 economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2014, then-President Michelle BACHELET introduced tax reforms aimed at delivering her campaign promise to fight inequality and to provide access to education and health care.

CMR,Cameroon,CM,17-Dec-19,"French Cameroon became independent in 1960 as the Republic of Cameroon. The following year the southern portion of neighboring British Cameroon voted to merge with the new country to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon. In 1972, a new constitution replaced the federation with a unitary state, the United Republic of Cameroon. The country has generally enjoyed stability, which has enabled the development of agriculture, roads, and railways, as well as a petroleum industry. Despite slow movement toward democratic reform, political power remains firmly in the hands of President Paul BIYA.","Central Africa, bordering the Bight of Biafra, between Equatorial Guinea and Nigeria","6 00 N, 12 00 E",Africa,"475,440 sq km","472,710 sq km","2,730 sq km",slightly larger than California; about four times the size of Pennsylvania,"5,018 km","Central African Republic 901 km, Chad 1116 km, Republic of the Congo 494 km, Equatorial Guinea 183 km, Gabon 349 km, Nigeria 1975 km",402 km,12 nm,,24 nm,,"varies with terrain, from tropical along coast to semiarid and hot in north","diverse, with coastal plain in southwest, dissected plateau in center, mountains in west, plains in north",667 m,Atlantic Ocean 0 m,"Fako on Mont Cameroun 4,045 m","petroleum, bauxite, iron ore, timber, hydropower",20.6% (2011 est.),13.1% (2011 est.),3.3% (2011 est.),4.2% (2011 est.),41.7% (2011 est.),37.7% (2011 est.),290 sq km (2012),"population concentrated in the west and north, with the interior of the country sparsely populated","&lt;p&gt;volcanic activity with periodic releases of poisonous gases from Lake Nyos and Lake Monoun volcanoes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;volcanism:&lt;/strong&gt; Mt.

Cameroonâ€™s economy suffers from factors that often impact underdeveloped countries, such as stagnant per capita income, a relatively inequitable distribution of income, a top-heavy civil service, endemic corruption, continuing inefficiencies of a large parastatal system in key sectors, and a generally unfavorable climate for business enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1990, the government has embarked on various IMF and World Bank programs designed to spur business investment, increase efficiency in agriculture, improve trade, and recapitalize the nation&#39;s banks. The IMF continues to press for economic reforms, including increased budget transparency, privatization, and poverty reduction programs. The Government of Cameroon provides subsidies for electricity, food, and fuel that have strained the federal budget and diverted funds from education, healthcare, and infrastructure projects, as low oil prices have led to lower revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameroon devotes significant resources to several large infrastructure projects currently under construction, including a deep seaport in Kribi and the Lom Pangar Hydropower Project.

Life expectancy remains low at about 55 years due to the prevalence of HIV and AIDs and an elevated maternal mortality rate, which has remained high since 1990. Cameroon, particularly the northern region, is vulnerable to food insecurity largely because of government mismanagement, corruption, high production costs, inadequate infrastructure, and natural disasters. Despite economic growth in some regions, poverty is on the rise, and is most prevalent in rural areas, which are especially affected by a shortage of jobs, declining incomes, poor school and health care infrastructure, and a lack of clean water and sanitation. Underinvestment in social safety nets and ineffective public financial management also contribute to Cameroonâ€™s high rate of poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International migration has been driven by unemployment (including fewer government jobs), poverty, the search for educational opportunities, and corruption.

CHN,Comoros,CN,17-Dec-19,"The archipelago of the Comoros in the Indian Ocean, composed of the islands of Mayotte, Anjouan, Moheli, and Grande Comore declared independence from France on 6 July 1975. Residents of Mayotte voted to remain in France, and France now has classified it as a department of France. Since independence, Comoros has endured political instability through realized and attempted coups. In 1997, the islands of Anjouan and Moheli declared independence from Comoros. In 1999, military chief Col. AZALI Assoumani seized power of the entire government in a bloodless coup; he initiated the 2000 Fomboni Accords, a power-sharing agreement in which the federal presidency rotates among the three islands, and each island maintains its local government. AZALI won the 2002 federal presidential election as president of the Union of the Comoros from Grande Comore Island, which held the first four-year term. AZALI stepped down in 2006 and President Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed SAMBI was elected to office as president from Anjouan. In 2007, Mohamed BACAR effected Anjouan&#39;s de-facto secession from the Union of the Comoros, refusing to step down when Comoros&#39; other islands held legitimate elections in July. The African Union (AU) initially attempted to resolve the political crisis by applying sanctions and a naval blockade to Anjouan, but in March 2008 the AU and Comoran soldiers seized the island. The island&#39;s inhabitants generally welcomed the move. In 2009, the Comorian population approved a constitutional referendum extending the term of the president from four years to five years. In May 2011, Ikililou DHOININE won the presidency in peaceful elections widely deemed to be free and fair. In closely contested elections in 2016, former President AZALI Assoumani won a second term, when the rotating presidency returned to Grande Comore.&amp;nbsp;A new constitution was passed in July&amp;nbsp;2018, which&amp;nbsp;allowed for two consecutive five-year presidential terms and abolished the island specific vice presidents. Under the new constitution, the incumbent president can run for a second term against candidates from the next island in line for the rotation. In August 2018,&amp;nbsp;President AZALI formed a new government and subsequently ran and was elected president in March 2019.","Southern Africa, group of islands at the northern mouth of the Mozambique Channel, about two-thirds of the way between northern Madagascar and northern Mozambique","12 10 S, 44 15 E",Africa,"2,235 sq km","2,235 sq km",0 sq km,"slightly more than 12 times the size of Washington, DC",,,340 km,12 nm,200 nm,,,tropical marine;

The low educational level of the labor force contributes to a subsistence level of economic activity and a heavy dependence on foreign grants and technical assistance. Agriculture, including fishing, hunting, and forestry, accounts for about 50% of GDP, employs a majority of the labor force, and provides most of the exports. Export income is heavily reliant on the three main crops of vanilla, cloves, and ylang ylang (perfume essence); and the Comoros&#39; export earnings are easily disrupted by disasters such as fires and extreme weather. Despite agricultureâ€™s importance to the economy, the country imports roughly 70% of its food; rice, the main staple, and other dried vegetables account for more than 25% of imports. Remittances from about 300,000 Comorans contribute about 25% of the countryâ€™s GDP. France, Comorosâ€™s colonial power, remains a key trading partner and bilateral donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comoros faces an education system in need of upgrades, limited opportunities for private commercial and industrial enterprises, poor health services, limited exports, and a high population growth rate. Recurring political instability, sometimes initiated from outside the country, and an ongoing electricity crisis have inhibited growth. The government, elected in mid-2016, has moved to improve revenue mobilization, reduce expenditures, and improve electricity access, although the public sector wage bill remains one of the highest in sub-Saharan Africa.

The Arab and Persian influence is most evident in the islandsâ€™ overwhelmingly Muslim majority â€“ about 98% of Comorans are Sunni Muslims. The country is densely populated, averaging nearly 350 people per square mile, although this varies widely among the islands, with Anjouan being the most densely populated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the large share of land dedicated to agriculture and Comorosâ€™ growing population, habitable land is becoming increasingly crowded. The combination of increasing population pressure on limited land and resources, widespread poverty, and poor job prospects motivates thousands of Comorans each year to attempt to illegally migrate using small fishing boats to the neighboring island of Mayotte, which is a French territory. The majority of legal Comoran migration to France came after Comorosâ€™ independence from France in 1975, with the flow peaking in the mid-1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 150,000 to 200,000 people of Comoran citizenship or descent live abroad, mainly in France, where they have gone seeking a better quality of life, job opportunities, higher education (Comoros has no universities), advanced health care, and to finance elaborate traditional wedding ceremonies (aada). Remittances from the diaspora are an economic mainstay, in 2013 representing approximately 25% of Comorosâ€™ GDP and significantly more than the value of its exports of goods and services (only 15% of GDP). Grand Comore, Comorosâ€™ most populous island, is both the primary source of emigrants and the main recipient of remittances. Most remittances are spent on private consumption, but this often goes toward luxury goods and the aada and does not contribute to economic development or poverty reduction. Although the majority of the diaspora is now French-born with more distant ties to Comoros, it is unclear whether they will sustain the current level of remittances.&lt;/p&gt;",,,,,,,,"Comoros is a source country for children subjected to forced labor and, reportedly, sex trafficking domestically, and women and children are subjected to forced labor in Mayotte; it is possibly a transit and destination country for Malagasy women and girls and a transit country for East African women and girls exploited in domestic service in the Middle East; Comoran children are forced to labor in domestic service, roadside and street vending, baking, fishing, and agriculture; some Comoran students at Koranic schools are exploited for forced agricultural or domestic labor, sometimes being subjected to physical and sexual abuse; Comoros may be particularly vulnerable to transnational trafficking because of inadequate border controls, government corruption, and the presence of international criminal networks","Tier 3 â€“ Comoros does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and was placed on Tier 3 after being on the Tier 2 Watch List for two consecutive years without making progress; Parliament passed revisions to the penal code in 2014, including anti-trafficking provisions and enforcement guidelines, but these amendments have not yet been passed approved by the President and put into effect; a new child labor law was passed in 2015 prohibiting child trafficking, but existing laws do not criminalize the forced prostitution of adults; authorities did not investigate, prosecute, or convict alleged trafficking offenders, including complicit officials; the government lacked victim identification and care referral procedures, did not assist any victims during 2014, and provided minimal support to NGOs offering victims psychosocial services (2015)",,,,,,,20% (1996 est.),,,,0 km,,,,,the US does not have an embassy in Comoros; the US Ambassador to Madagascar is accredited to Comoros,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
COL,Colombia,CO,17-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;Colombia was one of the three countries that emerged after the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1830 (the others are Ecuador and Venezuela). A decades-long conflict between government forces, paramilitaries, and antigovernment insurgent groups heavily funded by the drug trade, principally the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), escalated during the 1990s. More than 31,000 former United Self Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) paramilitaries demobilized by the end of 2006, and the AUC as a formal organization ceased to operate. In the wake of the paramilitary demobilization, illegal armed groups arose, whose members include some former paramilitaries. After four years of formal peace negotiations, the Colombian Government signed a final peace accord with the FARC in November 2016, which was subsequently ratified by the Colombian Congress. The accord calls for members of the FARC to demobilize, disarm, and reincorporate into society and politics. The accord also committed the Colombian Government to create three new institutions to form a &#39;comprehensive system for truth, justice, reparation, and non-repetition,&#39; to include a truth commission, a special unit to coordinate the search for those who disappeared during the conflict, and a &#39;Special Jurisdiction for Peace&#39; to administer justice for conflict-related crimes. The Colombian Government has stepped up efforts to expand its presence into every one of its administrative departments. Despite decades of internal conflict and drug-related security challenges, Colombia maintains relatively strong democratic institutions characterized by peaceful, transparent elections and the protection of civil liberties.&lt;/p&gt;","Northern South America, bordering the Caribbean Sea, between Panama and Venezuela, and bordering the North Pacific Ocean, between Ecuador and Panama","4 00 N, 72 00 W",South America,"1,138,910 sq km","1,038,700 sq km","100,210 sq km",slightly less than twice the size of Texas,"6,672 km","Brazil 1790 km, Ecuador 708 km, Panama 339 km, Peru 1494 km, Venezuela 2341 km","3,208 km (Caribbean Sea 1,760 km, North Pacific Ocean 1,448 km)",12 nm,200 nm,, 200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation,tropical along coast and eastern plains;

Colombia is Latin Americaâ€™s fourth largest oil producer and the worldâ€™s fourth largest coal producer, third largest coffee exporter, and second largest cut flowers exporter. Colombiaâ€™s economic development is hampered by inadequate infrastructure, poverty, narcotrafficking, and an uncertain security situation, in addition to dependence on primary commodities (goods that have little value-added from processing or labor inputs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colombiaâ€™s economy slowed in 2017 because of falling world market prices for oil and lower domestic oil production due to insurgent attacks on pipeline infrastructure. Although real GDP growth averaged 4.7% during the past decade, it fell to an estimated 1.8% in 2017. Declining oil prices also have contributed to reduced government revenues. In 2016, oil revenue dropped below 4% of the federal budget and likely remained below 4% in 2017. A Western credit rating agency in December 2017 downgraded Colombiaâ€™s sovereign credit rating to BBB-, because of weaker-than-expected growth and increasing external debt. Colombia has struggled to address local referendums against foreign investment, which have slowed its expansion, especially in the oil and mining sectors. Colombiaâ€™s FDI declined by 3% to $10.2 billion between January and September 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colombia has signed or is negotiating Free Trade Agreements (FTA) with more than a dozen countries; the US-Colombia FTA went into effect in May 2012. Colombia is a founding member of the Pacific Allianceâ€”a regional trade block formed in 2012 by Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru to promote regional trade and economic integration. The Colombian government took steps in 2017 to address several bilateral trade irritants with the US, including those on truck scrappage, distilled spirits, pharmaceuticals, ethanol imports, and labor rights.

The birth rate has fallen from more than 6 children per woman in the 1960s to just above replacement level today as a result of increased literacy, family planning services, and urbanization. However, income inequality is among the worst in the world, and more than a third of the population lives below the poverty line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colombia experiences significant legal and illegal economic emigration and refugee outflows. Large-scale labor emigration dates to the 1960s; the United States and, until recently, Venezuela have been the main host countries. Emigration to Spain picked up in the 1990s because of its economic growth, but this flow has since diminished because of Spainâ€™s ailing economy and high unemployment. Colombia has been the largest source of Latin American refugees in Latin America, nearly 400,000 of whom live primarily in Venezuela and Ecuador. Venezuelaâ€™s political and economic crisis since 2015, however, has created a reverse flow, consisting largely of Colombians returning home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forced displacement continues to be prevalent because of violence among guerrillas, paramilitary groups, and Colombian security forces. Afro-Colombian and indigenous populations are disproportionately affected. Even with the Colombian Governmentâ€™s December 2016 peace agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the risk of displacement remains as other rebel groups fill the void left by the FARC. Between 1985 and September 2017, nearly 7.6 million persons have been internally displaced, the highest total in the world. These estimates may undercount actual numbers because many internally displaced persons are not registered. Historically, Colombia also has one of the worldâ€™s highest levels of forced disappearances. About 30,000 cases have been recorded over the last four decadesâ€”although the number is likely to be much higherâ€”including human rights activists, trade unionists, Afro-Colombians, indigenous people, and farmers in rural conflict zones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of political violence and economic problems, Colombia received limited numbers of immigrants during the 19th and 20th centuries, mostly from the Middle East, Europe, and Japan. More recently, growth in the oil, mining, and manufacturing sectors has attracted increased labor migration; the primary source countries are Venezuela, the US, Mexico, and Argentina. Colombia has also become a transit area for illegal migrants from Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean -- especially Haiti and Cuba -- who are en route to the US or Canada.&lt;/p&gt;","2,141 km (2015)",150 km 1.435-m gauge (2015),"1,991 km 0.914-m gauge (2015)",,,,,,,"206,500 km (2016)",,,11 (2018),,,,,,Barranquilla (Rio Magdalena),,,,,,,"Boston, Chicago, San Francisco",,,,,,,,,,,,,Covenas offshore terminal,Puerto Bolivar (coal),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;aim(s):&lt;/strong&gt; Marxist-Leninist group that seeks to defend Colombians whom they believed to be victims of social, political, and economic injustices perpetrated by the Colombian government&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;area(s) of operation:&lt;/strong&gt; the nation&#39;s largest remaining insurgent group operates mainly in the rural and mountainous areas of northern, northeastern, and southwestern Colombia as well as border regions with Venezuela&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;note:&lt;/strong&gt; the group has a long history of engaging in narcotics production and trafficking, extortion of foreign and local companies, and kidnappings for ransom to fund operations; historically focused on attacking economic infrastructure, in particular oil and gas pipelines and electricity pylons (2019)","&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;aim(s):&lt;/strong&gt; signed a peace accord with the Colombian Government in 2016 (approved by the Colombian Congress on 30 November 2016) and entered the political arena in September 2017 as the People&#39;s Alternative Revolutionary Force (also known as FARC) in order to change Colombia&#39;s economic model, push an agenda focused on social justice and development of rural areas; historically, the FARC&#39;s aim has been to install a Marxist-Leninist regime in Colombia through a violent revolution&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;area(s) of operation: &lt;/strong&gt;NA (2018)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CUB,Cuba,CU,17-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;The native Amerindian population of Cuba began to decline after the European discovery of the island by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1492 and following its development as a Spanish colony during the next several centuries. Large numbers of African slaves were imported to work the coffee and sugar plantations, and Havana became the launching point for the annual treasure fleets bound for Spain from Mexico and Peru. Spanish rule eventually provoked an independence movement and occasional rebellions were harshly suppressed. US intervention during the Spanish-American War in 1898 assisted the Cubans in overthrowing Spanish rule. The Treaty of Paris established Cuban independence from Spain in 1898 and, following three-and-a-half years of subsequent US military rule, Cuba became an independent republic in 1902 after which the island experienced a string of governments mostly dominated by the military and corrupt politicians. Fidel CASTRO led a rebel army to victory in 1959; his authoritarian rule held the subsequent regime together for nearly five decades. He stepped down as president in February 2008 in favor of his younger brother Raul CASTRO. Cuba&#39;s communist revolution, with Soviet support, was exported throughout Latin America and Africa during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Miguel DIAZ-CANEL Bermudez, hand-picked by Raul CASTRO to succeed him, was approved as president by the National Assembly and took office on 19 April 2018.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The country faced a severe economic downturn in 1990 following the withdrawal of former Soviet subsidies worth $4-6 billion annually. Cuba traditionally and consistently portrays the US embargo, in place since 1961, as the source of its difficulties. As a result of efforts begun in December 2014 to re-establish diplomatic relations with the Cuban Government, which were severed in January 1961, the US and Cuba reopened embassies in their respective countries in July 2015. The embargo remains in place, and the relationship between the US and Cuba remains tense.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Illicit migration of Cuban nationals to the US via maritime and overland routes has been a longstanding challenge. On 12 January 2017, the US and Cuba signed a Joint Statement ending the so-called &quot;wet-foot, dry-foot&quot; policy &amp;ndash; by which Cuban nationals who reached US soil were permitted to stay. Illicit Cuban migration by sea has since dropped significantly, but land border crossings continue. In FY 2018, the US Coast Guard interdicted 312 Cuban nationals at sea.

In April 2011, the government held the first Cuban Communist Party Congress in almost 13 years, during which leaders approved a plan for wide-ranging economic changes. Since then, the government has slowly and incrementally implemented limited economic reforms, including allowing Cubans to buy electronic appliances and cell phones, stay in hotels, and buy and sell used cars. The government has cut state sector jobs as part of the reform process, and it has opened up some retail services to &quot;self-employment,&quot; leading to the rise of so-called &quot;cuentapropistas&quot; or entrepreneurs. More than 500,000 Cuban workers are currently registered as self-employed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Cuban regime has updated its economic model to include permitting the private ownership and sale of real estate and new vehicles, allowing private farmers to sell agricultural goods directly to hotels, allowing the creation of non-agricultural cooperatives, adopting a new foreign investment law, and launching a &quot;Special Development Zone&quot; around the Mariel port.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since 2016, Cuba has attributed slowed economic growth in part to problems with petroleum product deliveries from Venezuela. Since late 2000, Venezuela provided petroleum products to Cuba on preferential terms, supplying at times nearly 100,000 barrels per day. Cuba paid for the oil, in part, with the services of Cuban personnel in Venezuela, including some 30,000 medical professionals.&lt;/p&gt;",$137 billion,$93.79 billion (2017 est.),1.60%,"$12,300 ",11.4% of GDP,57% (2017 est.),31.6% (2017 est.),9.6% (2017 est.),0% (2017 est.),14.6% (2017 est.),-12.7% (2017 est.),4% (2017 est.),22.7% (2017 est.),73.4% (2017 est.),"sugar, tobacco, citrus, coffee, rice, potatoes, beans;

CYP,Cyprus,CY,26-Dec-19,"A former British colony, Cyprus became independent in 1960 following years of resistance to British rule. Tensions between the Greek Cypriot majority and Turkish Cypriot minority communities came to a head in December 1963, when violence broke out in the capital of Nicosia. Despite the deployment of UN peacekeepers in 1964, sporadic intercommunal violence continued, forcing most Turkish Cypriots into enclaves throughout the island. In 1974, a Greek Government-sponsored attempt to overthrow the elected president of Cyprus was met by military intervention from Turkey, which soon controlled more than a third of the island. In 1983, the Turkish Cypriot administered area declared itself the &quot;Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&quot; (&quot;TRNC&quot;), but it is recognized only by Turkey. An UN-mediated agreement, the Annan Plan, failed to win approval by both communities in 2004. In February 2014, after a hiatus of nearly two years, the leaders of the two communities resumed formal discussions under UN auspices aimed at reuniting the divided island. The most recent round of negotiations to reunify the island were suspended in&amp;nbsp;July 2017 after failure to achieve a breakthrough. The entire island entered the EU on 1 May 2004, although the EU acquis - the body of common rights and obligations - applies only to the areas under the internationally recognized government, and is suspended in the &quot;TRNC.&quot; However, individual Turkish Cypriots able to document their eligibility for Republic of Cyprus citizenship legally enjoy the same rights accorded to other citizens of EU states.","Middle East, island in the Mediterranean Sea, south of Turkey;

Tourism, finance, shipping, and real estate have traditionally been the most important services. Cyprus has been a member of the EU since May 2004 and adopted the euro as its national currency in January 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the first five years of EU membership, the Cyprus economy grew at an average rate of about 4%, with unemployment between 2004 and 2008 averaging about 4%. However, the economy tipped into recession in 2009 as the ongoing global financial crisis and resulting low demand hit the tourism and construction sectors. An overextended banking sector with excessive exposure to Greek debt added to the contraction. Cyprusâ€™ biggest two banks were among the largest holders of Greek bonds in Europe and had a substantial presence in Greece through bank branches and subsidiaries. Following numerous downgrades of its credit rating, Cyprus lost access to international capital markets in May 2011. In July 2012, Cyprus became the fifth euro-zone government to request an economic bailout program from the European Commission, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund - known collectively as the &quot;Troika.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the election of President Nikos ANASTASIADES in February 2013, Cyprus reached an agreement with the Troika on a $13 billion bailout that triggered a two-week bank closure and the imposition of capital controls that remained partially in place until April 2015. Cyprus&#39; two largest banks merged and the combined entity was recapitalized through conversion of some large bank deposits to shares and imposition of losses on bank bondholders. As with other EU countries, the Troika conditioned the bailout on passing financial and structural reforms and privatizing state-owned enterprises. Despite downsizing and restructuring, the Cypriot financial sector remains burdened by the largest stock of non-performing loans in the euro zone, equal to nearly half of all loans. Since the bailout, Cyprus has received positive appraisals by the Troika and outperformed fiscal targets but has struggled to overcome political opposition to bailout-mandated legislation, particularly regarding privatizations. The rate of non-performing loans (NPLs) is still very high at around 49%, and growth would accelerate if Cypriot banks could increase the pace of resolution of the NPLs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 2013, a US-Israeli consortium completed preliminary appraisals of hydrocarbon deposits in Cyprusâ€™ exclusive economic zone (EEZ), which estimated gross mean reserves of about 130 billion cubic meters. Though exploration continues in Cyprusâ€™ EEZ, no additional commercially exploitable reserves have been identified. Developing offshore hydrocarbon resources remains a critical component of the governmentâ€™s economic recovery efforts, but development has been delayed as a result of regional developments and disagreements about exploitation methods.&lt;/p&gt;",$31.78 billion,$21.7 billion (2017 est.),3.90%,"$37,200 ",13.7% of GDP,68.7% (2017 est.),14.9% (2017 est.),21.1% (2017 est.),-0.7% (2017 est.),63.8% (2017 est.),-67.8% (2017 est.),2% (2017 est.),12.5% (2017 est.),85.5% (2017 est.),"citrus, vegetables, barley, grapes, olives, vegetables;

The market-based economy of the &quot;TRNC&quot; is roughly one-fifth the size of its southern neighbor and is likewise dominated by the service sector with a large portion of the population employed by the government. In 2012 - the latest year for which data are available - the services sector, which includes the public sector, trade, tourism, and education, contributed 58.7% to economic output. In the same year, light manufacturing and agriculture contributed 2.7% and 6.2%, respectively. Manufacturing is limited mainly to food and beverages, furniture and fixtures, construction materials, metal and non-metal products, textiles and clothing. The &quot;TRNC&quot; maintains few economic ties with the Republic of Cyprus outside of trade in construction materials. Since its creation, the &quot;TRNC&quot; has heavily relied on financial assistance from Turkey, which supports the &quot;TRNC&quot; defense, telecommunications, water and postal services. The Turkish Lira is the preferred currency, though foreign currencies are widely accepted in business transactions. The &quot;TRNC&quot; remains vulnerable to the Turkish market and monetary policy because of its use of the Turkish Lira. The &quot;TRNC&quot; weathered the European financial crisis relatively unscathed - compared to the Republic of Cyprus - because of the lack of financial sector development, the health of the Turkish economy, and its separation from the rest of the island.

Hassan Gouled APTIDON installed an authoritarian one-party state and proceeded to serve as president until 1999.

In 1999, Djibouti&#39;s first multiparty presidential election resulted in the election of Ismail Omar GUELLEH as president; he was reelected to a second term in 2005 and extended his tenure in office via a constitutional amendment, which allowed him to serve a third term in 2011 and begin a fourth term in 2016.

Three-fourths of Djibouti&#39;s inhabitants live in the capital city; the remainder are mostly nomadic herders. Scant rainfall and less than 4% arable land limits crop production to small quantities of fruits and vegetables, and most food must be imported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for the region and an international transshipment and refueling center. Imports, exports, and reexports represent 70% of port activity at Djibouti&#39;s container terminal. Reexports consist primarily of coffee from landlocked neighbor Ethiopia. Djibouti has few natural resources and little industry. The nation is, therefore, heavily dependent on foreign assistance to support its balance of payments and to finance development projects. An official unemployment rate of nearly 40% - with youth unemployment near 80% - continues to be a major problem. Inflation was a modest 3% in 2014-2017, due to low international food prices and a decline in electricity tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Djiboutiâ€™s reliance on diesel-generated electricity and imported food and water leave average consumers vulnerable to global price shocks, though in mid-2015 Djibouti passed new legislation to liberalize the energy sector. The government has emphasized infrastructure development for transportation and energy and Djibouti â€“ with the help of foreign partners, particularly China â€“ has begun to increase and modernize its port capacity. In 2017, Djibouti opened two of the largest projects in its history, the Doraleh Port and Djibouti-Addis Ababa Railway, funded by China as part of the &quot;Belt and Road Initiative,&quot; which will increase the countryâ€™s ability to capitalize on its strategic location.&lt;/p&gt;",$3.64 billion,$2.029 billion (2017 est.),6.70%,"$3,600 ",22.3% of GDP,56.5% (2017 est.),29.2% (2017 est.),41.8% (2017 est.),0.3% (2017 est.),38.6% (2017 est.),-66.4% (2017 est.),2.4% (2017 est.),17.3% (2017 est.),80.2% (2017 est.),"fruits, vegetables; goats, sheep, camels, animal hides","construction, agricultural processing, shipping",2.7% (2017 est.),"294,600 (2012)", NA, NA, NA,40%,23% (2015 est.),2.40%,30.9% (2002),717 million (2017 est.),899.2 million (2017 est.),35.3% (of GDP) (2017 est.),-9% (of GDP) (2017 est.),31.8% of GDP,calendar year,0.70%,,11.45%,$1.361 billion,$1.361 billion,$659.4 million,,-$280 million,,"Ethiopia 38.8%, Somalia 17.1%, Qatar 9.1%, Brazil 8.9%, Yemen 4.9%, US 4.6% (2017)","reexports, hides and skins, scrap metal",$726.4 million,"foods, beverages, transport equipment, chemicals, petroleum products, clothing","UAE 25%, France 15.2%, Saudi Arabia 11%, China 9.6%, Ethiopia 6.8%, Yemen 4.6% (2017)",$398.5 million,$1.519 billion,$1.483 billion,,Djiboutian francs (DJF) per US dollar -,,405.5 million kWh (2016 est.),377.1 million kWh (2016 est.),0 kWh (2016 est.),0 kWh (2016 est.),"130,300 kW (2016 est.)",100% of total installed capacity (2016 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),0 bbl/day (2018 est.),0 bbl/day (2015 est.),0 bbl/day (2015 est.),0 bbl (1 January 2018 est.),0 bbl/day (2015 est.),"6,360 bbl/day (2016 est.)",403 bbl/day (2015 est.),"6,692 bbl/day (2015 est.)",0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (1 January 2014 est.),"950,200 Mt (2017 est.)","36,582",4 (2017 est.),"373,052",43 (2017 est.),"telephone facilities in the city of Djibouti are adequate, as are the microwave radio relay connections to outlying areas of the country; Djibouti is one of the few remaining countries in which the national telco, Djibouti Telecom (DT), has a monopoly on all telecom services, including fixed lines, mobile, Internet and broadband; the lack of competition has meant that the market has not lived up to its potential (2018)","Djibouti Telecom&amp;nbsp; (DT) is the sole provider of telecommunications services and utilizes mostly a microwave radio relay network; fiber-optic cable is installed in the capital; rural areas connected via wireless local loop radio systems; mobile cellular coverage is primarily limited to the area in and around Djibouti city; 4 per 100 fixed-line, 43 per 100 moblie-cellular (2018)","country code - 253; landing point for the SEA-ME-WE-3 &amp;amp; 5, EASSy, Aden-Djibouti, Africa-1, DARE-1, EIG, MENA, Bridge International, PEACE Cable, and SEACOM&amp;nbsp;fiber-optic submarine cable systems providing links to Asia, the Middle East, Europe,&amp;nbsp;Southeast Asia, Australia&amp;nbsp;and Africa; satellite earth stations - 2 (1 Intelsat - Indian Ocean and 1 Arabsat) (2019)","state-owned Radiodiffusion-Television de Djibouti operates the sole terrestrial TV station, as well as the only 2 domestic radio networks; no private TV or radio stations; transmissions of several international broadcasters are available (2019)",.dj,"111,212",13.1% (July 2016 est.),"24,389",3 (2017 est.),,"Djibouti Armed Forces (FAD): Djibouti National Army (includes Navy, Djiboutian Air Force, National Gendarmerie); Djibouti Coast Guard (2019)",18 years of age for voluntary military service; 16-25 years of age for voluntary military training; no conscription (2012),2 (2015),4 (2015),,,J2 (2016),13 (2013),3 (2017),1 (2017),1 (2017),1 (2017),,,10 (2013),,,1 (2013),7 (2013),2 (2013),,,,,15,other 15 (2018),,,,"&lt;p&gt;Djibouti maintains economic ties and border accords with &quot;Somaliland&quot; leadership while maintaining some political ties to various factions in Somalia; Kuwait is chief investor in the 2008 restoration and upgrade of the Ethiopian-Djibouti rail link; in 2008, Eritrean troops moved across the border on Ras Doumera peninsula and occupied Doumera Island with undefined sovereignty in the Red Sea&lt;/p&gt;",,,19% (2012),high (2016),"bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever (2016)",dengue fever (2016),29.9% (2012),,40.9,,"400,000 (2016)",51.8% (2016),67.4% (2016),2% (2016),,,,Djibouti,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"&lt;p&gt;Djibouti is a poor, predominantly urban country, characterized by high rates of illiteracy, unemployment, and childhood malnutrition.

Prone to droughts and floods, the country has few natural resources and must import more than 80% of its food from neighboring countries or Europe. Health care, particularly outside the capital, is limited by poor infrastructure, shortages of equipment and supplies, and a lack of qualified personnel. More than a third of health care recipients are migrants because the services are still better than those available in their neighboring home countries. The nearly universal practice of female genital cutting reflects Djiboutiâ€™s lack of gender equality and is a major contributor to obstetrical complications and its high rates of maternal and infant mortality. A 1995 law prohibiting the practice has never been enforced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of its political stability and its strategic location at the confluence of East Africa and the Gulf States along the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea, Djibouti is a key transit point for migrants and asylum seekers heading for the Gulf States and beyond.

However, with the escalation of the ongoing Yemen conflict, Yemenis began fleeing to Djibouti in March 2015, with almost 20,000 arriving by August 2017. Most Yemenis remain unregistered and head for Djibouti City rather than seeking asylum at one of Djiboutiâ€™s three spartan refugee camps.

DOM,Dominica,DO,17-Dec-19,"Dominica was the last of the Caribbean islands to be colonized by Europeans due chiefly to the fierce resistance of the native Caribs. France ceded possession to Great Britain in 1763, which colonized the island in 1805. Slavery ended in 1833 and in 1835 the first three men of African descent were elected to the legislative assembly of Dominica. In 1871, Dominica became part first of the British Leeward Islands and then the British Windward Islands until 1958. In 1967 Dominica became an associated state of the UK, and formally took responsibility for its internal affairs. In 1980, two years after independence, Dominica&#39;s fortunes improved when a corrupt and tyrannical administration was replaced by that of Mary Eugenia CHARLES, the first female prime minister in the Caribbean, who remained in office for 15 years. On 18 September 2017, Hurricane Maria passed over the island causing extensive damage to structures, roads, communications, and the power supply, and largely destroying critical agricultural areas.","Caribbean, island between the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, about halfway between Puerto Rico and Trinidad and Tobago","15 25 N, 61 20 W",Central America and the Caribbean,751 sq km,751 sq km, NEGL,"slightly more than four times the size of Washington, DC",,,148 km,12 nm,200 nm,24 nm,,tropical;

ECU,Ecuador,EC,17-Dec-19,"What is now Ecuador formed part of the northern Inca Empire until the Spanish conquest in 1533. Quito became a seat of Spanish colonial government in 1563 and part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada in 1717. The territories of the Viceroyalty - New Granada (Colombia), Venezuela, and Quito - gained their independence between 1819 and 1822 and formed a federation known as Gran Colombia. When Quito withdrew in 1830, the traditional name was changed in favor of the &quot;Republic of the Equator.&quot; Between 1904 and 1942, Ecuador lost territories in a series of conflicts with its neighbors. A border war with Peru that flared in 1995 was resolved in 1999. Although Ecuador marked 30 years of civilian governance in 2004, the period was marred by political instability. Protests in Quito contributed to the mid-term ouster of three of Ecuador&#39;s last four democratically elected presidents. In late 2008, voters approved a new constitution, Ecuador&#39;s 20th since gaining independence. General elections were held in April 2017, and voters elected President Lenin MORENO.","Western South America, bordering the Pacific Ocean at the Equator, between Colombia and Peru","2 00 S, 77 30 W",South America,"283,561 sq km","276,841 sq km","6,720 sq km",slightly smaller than Nevada,"2,237 km","Colombia 708 km, Peru 1529 km","2,237 km",200 nm,200 nm,,200 nm,"tropical along coast, becoming cooler inland at higher elevations;

Dollarization stabilized the economy, and positive growth returned in most of the years that followed. China has become Ecuador&#39;s largest foreign lender since 2008 and now accounts for 77.7% of the Ecuadorâ€™s bilateral debt. Various economic policies under the CORREA administration, such as an announcement in 2017 that Ecuador would terminate 13 bilateral investment treaties - including one with the US, generated economic uncertainty and discouraged private investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faced with a 2013 trade deficit of $1.1 billion, Ecuador imposed tariff surcharges from 5% to 45% on an estimated 32% of imports. Ecuadorâ€™s economy fell into recession in 2015 and remained in recession in 2016. Declining oil prices and exports forced the CORREA administration to cut government oulays. Foreign investment in Ecuador is low as a result of the unstable regulatory environment and weak rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;n April of 2017, Lenin MORENO was elected President of Ecuador by popular vote. His immediate challenge was to reengage the private sector to improve cash flow in the country. Ecuadorâ€™s economy returned to positive, but sluggish, growth.

EST,European Union,EE,17-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;Following the two devastating World Wars in the first half of the 20th century, a number of far-sighted European leaders in the late 1940s sought a response to the overwhelming desire for peace and reconciliation on the continent. In 1950, the French Foreign Minister Robert SCHUMAN proposed pooling the production of coal and steel in Western Europe and setting up an organization for that purpose that would bring France and the Federal Republic of Germany together and would be open to other countries as well. The following year, the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was set up when six members - Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands - signed the Treaty of Paris.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ECSC was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other elements of the countries&#39; economies. In 1957, envisioning an &quot;ever closer union,&quot; the Treaties of Rome created the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market. In 1967, the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the European Community (EC), creating a single Commission, a single Council of Ministers, and the body known today as the European Parliament. Members of the European Parliament were initially selected by national parliaments, but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and have been held every five years since.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1973, the first enlargement of the EC took place with the addition of Denmark, Ireland, and the UK. The 1980s saw further membership expansion with Greece joining in 1981 and Spain and Portugal in 1986. The 1992 Treaty of Maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy, in judicial and internal affairs, and in the creation of an economic and monetary union - including a common currency. This further integration created the European Union (EU), at the time standing alongside the EC. In 1995, Austria, Finland, and Sweden joined the EU/EC, raising the membership total to 15.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A new currency, the euro, was launched in world money markets on 1 January 1999; it became the unit of exchange for all EU member states except Denmark, Sweden, and the UK. In 2002, citizens of those 12 countries began using euro banknotes and coins. Ten new countries joined the EU in 2004 - Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Bulgaria and Romania joined in 2007 and Croatia in 2013, bringing the current membership to 28. (Seven of these new countries - Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Slovakia, and Slovenia - have now adopted the euro, bringing total euro-zone membership to 19.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an effort to ensure that the EU could function efficiently with an expanded membership, the Treaty of Nice (concluded in 2000; entered into force in 2003) set forth rules to streamline the size and procedures of EU institutions. An effort to establish a &quot;Constitution for Europe,&quot; growing out of a Convention held in 2002-2003, foundered when it was rejected in referenda in France and the Netherlands in 2005. A subsequent effort in 2007 incorporated many of the features of the rejected draft Constitutional Treaty while also making a number of substantive and symbolic changes. The new treaty, referred to as the Treaty of Lisbon, sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them. The treaty was approved at the EU intergovernmental conference of the then 27 member states held in Lisbon in December 2007, after which the process of national ratifications began. In October 2009, an Irish referendum approved the Lisbon Treaty (overturning a previous rejection) and cleared the way for an ultimate unanimous endorsement. Poland and the Czech Republic ratified soon after. The Lisbon Treaty came into force on 1 December 2009 and the EU officially replaced and succeeded the EC. The Treaty&#39;s provisions are part of the basic consolidated versions of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) now governing what remains a very specific integration project.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;UK citizens on 23 June 2016 narrowly voted to leave the EU. The EU and UK have negotiated, but not ratified, a Withdrawal Agreement that if ratified would include a status quo transition period through December 2020, which could be extended if both sides agree.&lt;/p&gt;","Europe between the North Atlantic Ocean in the west and Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine to the east",,Europe,,,,less than one-half the size of the US,"13,271 km","Albania 212 km, Andorra 118 km, Belarus 1176 km, Bosnia and Herzegovina 956 km, Holy See 3 km, Liechtenstein 34 km, Macedonia 396 km, Moldova 683 km, Monaco 6 km, Montenegro 19 km, Norway 2375 km, Russia 2435 km, San Marino 37 km, Serbia 1353 km, Switzerland 1729 km, Turkey 415 km, Ukraine 1324 km","65,992.9 km",,,,,cold temperate;

A common currency â€“ the euro â€“ circulates among 19 of the member states that make up the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Eleven member states introduced the euro as their common currency on 1 January 1999 (Greece did so two years later). Since 2004, 13 states acceded to the EU. Of the 13, Slovenia (2007), Cyprus and Malta (2008), Slovakia (2009), Estonia (2011), Latvia (2014), and Lithuania (2015) have adopted the euro; 7 other member states - excluding the UK and Denmark, which have formal opt-outs - are required by EU treaties to adopt the common currency upon meeting fiscal and monetary convergence criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU economy posted moderate GDP growth for 2014 through 2017, capping five years of sustained growth since the 2008-09 global economic crisis and the ensuing sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone in 2011. However, the blocâ€™s recovery has been uneven. Some EU member states (Czechia, Ireland, Malta, Romania, Sweden, and Spain) have recorded strong growth, others (Italy and the UK) are experiencing modest expansion and some (Greece) have only recently shaken off recession. Only Greece remains under an EU rescue program (due to end in August 2018), while Cyprus, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain have successfully concluded their agreements. Overall, the EUâ€™s recovery has been buoyed by lower commodities prices and accommodative monetary policy, which has lowered interest rates and stimulated demand. The euro zone, which makes up about 70% of the total EU economy, is also performing well, achieving a growth rate not seen in a decade. In October 2017 the European Central Bank (ECB) announced it would extend its bond-buying program through September 2018, and possibly beyond that date, to keep the euro zone recovery on track. The ECBâ€™s efforts to spur more lending and investment through its asset-buying program, negative interest rates, and long-term loan refinancing programs have not yet raised inflation in line with the ECBâ€™s statutory target of just under 2%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its performance, high unemployment in some member states, high levels of public and private debt, muted productivity, an incomplete single market in services, and an aging population remain sources of potential drag on the EUâ€™s future growth. Moreover, the EU economy remains vulnerable to a slowdown of global trade and bouts of political and financial turmoil. In June 2016, the UK voted to withdraw from the EU, the first member country ever to attempt to secede. Continued uncertainty about the implications of the UKâ€™s exit from the EU (set for March 2019) could hurt consumer and investor confidence and dampen EU growth, particularly if trade and cross-border investment significantly declines. Political disagreements between EU member states on reforms to fiscal and economic policy also may impair the EUâ€™s ability to bolster its crisis-prevention and resolution mechanisms. International investorsâ€™ fears of a broad dissolution of the single currency area have largely dissipated, but these concerns could resurface if elected leaders implement policies that contravene euro-zone budget or banking rules. State interventions in ailing banks, including rescue of banks in Italy and resolution of banks in Spain, have eased financial vulnerabilities in the European banking sector even though some banks are struggling with low profitability and a large stock of bad loans, fragilities that could precipitate localized crises. Externally, the EU has continued to pursue comprehensive free trade agreements to expand EU external market share, particularly with Asian countries; EU and Japanese leaders reached a political-level agreement on a free trade agreement in July 2017, and agreement with Mexico in April 2018 on updates to an existing free trade agreement.&lt;/p&gt;",$20.85 trillion,$17.11 trillion (2017 est.),2.30%,"$40,900 ",22.7% of GDP,54.4% (2016 est.),20.4% (2016 est.),19.8% (2016 est.),0.4% (2016 est.),43.9% (2016 est.),-40.5% (2016 est.),1.6% (2017 est.),25.1% (2017 est.),70.9% (2017 est.),"wheat, barley, oilseeds, sugar beets, wine, grapes;

EGY,Egypt,EG,23-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;The regularity and richness of the annual Nile River flood, coupled with semi-isolation provided by deserts to the east and west, allowed for the development of one of the world&#39;s great civilizations. A unified kingdom arose circa 3200 B.C., and a series of dynasties ruled in Egypt for the next three millennia. The last native dynasty fell to the Persians in 341 B.C., who in turn were replaced by the Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines. It was the Arabs who introduced Islam and the Arabic language in the 7th century and who ruled for the next six centuries. A local military caste, the Mamluks took control about 1250 and continued to govern after the conquest of Egypt by the Ottoman Turks in 1517. Completion of the Suez Canal in 1869 elevated Egypt as an important world transportation hub. Ostensibly to protect its investments, Britain seized control of Egypt&#39;s government in 1882, but nominal allegiance to the Ottoman Empire continued until 1914. Partially independent from the UK in 1922, Egypt acquired full sovereignty from Britain in 1952. The completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1971 and the resultant Lake Nasser have reaffirmed the time-honored place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt. A rapidly growing population (the largest in the Arab world), limited arable land, and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and stress society. The government has struggled to meet the demands of Egypt&#39;s fast-growing population as it implements far-reaching economic reforms, including the reduction of select subsidies, large-scale infrastructure projects, energy cooperation, and foreign direct investment appeals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Inspired by the 2010 Tunisian revolution, Egyptian opposition groups led demonstrations and labor strikes countrywide, culminating in President Hosni MUBARAK&#39;s ouster in 2011. Egypt&#39;s military assumed national leadership until a new legislature was in place in early 2012; later that same year, Muhammad MURSI won the presidential election. Following protests throughout the spring of 2013 against MURSI&#39;s government and the Muslim Brotherhood, the Egyptian Armed Forces intervened and removed MURSI from power in July 2013 and replaced him with interim president Adly MANSOUR. Simultaneously, the government began enacting laws to limit freedoms of assembly and expression. In January 2014, voters approved a new constitution by referendum and in May 2014 elected former defense minister Abdelfattah ELSISI president. Egypt elected a new legislature in December 2015,&amp;nbsp;its first Hose of Representatives since 2012. ELSISI was reelected to a second four-year term in March 2018. In April 2019, Egypt approved via national referendum a set of constitutional amendments extending ELSISI&amp;rsquo;s term in office through 2024 and possibly through 2030 if re-elected for a third term. The amendments would also allow future presidents up to two consecutive six-year terms in office, re-establish an upper legislative house, allow for one or more vice presidents, establish a 25% quota for female legislators, reaffirm the military&amp;rsquo;s role as guardian of Egypt, and expand presidential authority to appoint the heads of judicial councils.&lt;/p&gt;

Egypt&#39;s economy was highly centralized during the rule of former President Gamal Abdel NASSER but opened up considerably under former Presidents Anwar EL-SADAT and Mohamed Hosni MUBARAK. Agriculture, hydrocarbons, manufacturing, tourism, and other service sectors drove the countryâ€™s relatively diverse economic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Egyptâ€™s mixed record for attracting foreign investment over the past two decades, poor living conditions and limited job opportunities have contributed to public discontent. These socioeconomic pressures were a major factor leading to the January 2011 revolution that ousted MUBARAK. The uncertain political, security, and policy environment since 2011 has restricted economic growth and failed to alleviate persistent unemployment, especially among the young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late 2016, persistent dollar shortages and waning aid from its Gulf allies led Cairo to turn to the IMF for a 3-year, $12 billion loan program. To secure the deal, Cairo floated its currency, introduced new taxes, and cut energy subsidies - all of which pushed inflation above 30% for most of 2017, a high that had not been seen in a generation. Since the currency float, foreign investment in Egyptâ€™s high interest treasury bills has risen exponentially, boosting both dollar availability and central bank reserves. Cairo will be challenged to obtain foreign and local investment in manufacturing and other sectors without a sustained effort to implement a range of business reforms.&lt;/p&gt;",$1.204 trillion,$236.5 billion (2017 est.),4.20%,"$12,700 ",9% of GDP,86.8% (2017 est.),10.1% (2017 est.),14.8% (2017 est.),0.5% (2017 est.),16.3% (2017 est.),-28.5% (2017 est.),11.7% (2017 est.),34.3% (2017 est.),54% (2017 est.),"cotton, rice, corn, wheat, beans, fruits, vegetables;

Most of the country is desert, so about 95% of the population is concentrated in a narrow strip of fertile land along the Nile River, which represents only about 5% of Egyptâ€™s land area. Egyptâ€™s rapid population growth â€“ 46% between 1994 and 2014 â€“ stresses limited natural resources, jobs, housing, sanitation, education, and health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the countryâ€™s total fertility rate (TFR) fell from roughly 5.5 children per woman in 1980 to just over 3 in the late 1990s, largely as a result of state-sponsored family planning programs, the population growth rate dropped more modestly because of decreased mortality rates and longer life expectancies. During the last decade, Egyptâ€™s TFR decline stalled for several years and then reversed, reaching 3.6 in 2011, and has plateaued the last few years. Contraceptive use has held steady at about 60%, while preferences for larger families and early marriage may have strengthened in the wake of the recent 2011 revolution. The large cohort of women of or nearing childbearing age will sustain high population growth for the foreseeable future (an effect called population momentum).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, post-MUBARAK governments have not made curbing population growth a priority. To increase contraceptive use and to prevent further overpopulation will require greater government commitment and substantial social change, including encouraging smaller families and better educating and empowering women. Currently, literacy, educational attainment, and labor force participation rates are much lower for women than men. In addition, the prevalence of violence against women, the lack of female political representation, and the perpetuation of the nearly universal practice of female genital cutting continue to keep women from playing a more significant role in Egyptâ€™s public sphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Population pressure, poverty, high unemployment, and the fragmentation of inherited land holdings have historically motivated Egyptians, primarily young men, to migrate internally from rural and smaller urban areas in the Nile Delta region and the poorer rural south to Cairo, Alexandria, and other urban centers in the north, while a much smaller number migrated to the Red Sea and Sinai areas. Waves of forced internal migration also resulted from the 1967 Arab-Israeli War and the floods caused by the completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1970. Limited numbers of students and professionals emigrated temporarily prior to the early 1970s, when economic problems and high unemployment pushed the Egyptian Government to lift restrictions on labor migration. At the same time, high oil revenues enabled Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and other Gulf states, as well as Libya and Jordan, to fund development projects, creating a demand for unskilled labor (mainly in construction), which attracted tens of thousands of young Egyptian men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1970 and 1974 alone, Egyptian migrants in the Gulf countries increased from approximately 70,000 to 370,000. Egyptian officials encouraged legal labor migration both to alleviate unemployment and to generate remittance income (remittances continue to be one of Egyptâ€™s largest sources of foreign currency and GDP). During the mid-1980s, however, depressed oil prices resulting from the Iran-Iraq War, decreased demand for low-skilled labor, competition from less costly South Asian workers, and efforts to replace foreign workers with locals significantly reduced Egyptian migration to the Gulf States. The number of Egyptian migrants dropped from a peak of almost 3.3 million in 1983 to about 2.2 million at the start of the 1990s, but numbers gradually recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 2000s, Egypt began facilitating more labor migration through bilateral agreements, notably with Arab countries and Italy, but illegal migration to Europe through overstayed visas or maritime human smuggling via Libya also rose. The Egyptian Government estimated there were 6.5 million Egyptian migrants in 2009, with roughly 75% being temporary migrants in other Arab countries (Libya, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates) and 25% being predominantly permanent migrants in the West (US, UK, Italy, France, and Canada).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the 2000s, Egypt became an increasingly important transit and destination country for economic migrants and asylum seekers, including Palestinians, East Africans, and South Asians and, more recently, Iraqis and Syrians. Egypt draws many refugees because of its resettlement programs with the West; Cairo has one of the largest urban refugee populations in the world. Many East African migrants are interned or live in temporary encampments along the Egypt-Israel border, and some have been shot and killed by Egyptian border guards.&lt;/p&gt;","5,085 km (2014)","5,085 km 1.435-m gauge (62 km electrified) (2014)",,,,,,"Egypt is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor; Egyptian children, including the large population of street children are vulnerable to forced labor in domestic service, begging and agriculture or may be victims of sex trafficking or child sex tourism, which occurs in Cairo, Alexandria, and Luxor; some Egyptian women and girls are sold into &quot;temporary&quot; or &quot;summer&quot; marriages with Gulf men, through the complicity of their parents or marriage brokers, and are exploited for prostitution or forced labor; Egyptian men are subject to forced labor in neighboring countries, while adults from South and Southeast Asia and East Africa â€“ and increasingly Syrian refugees â€“ are forced to work in domestic service, construction, cleaning, and begging in Egypt; women and girls, including migrants and refugees, from Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East are sex trafficked in Egypt; the Egyptian military cracked down on criminal groupâ€™s smuggling, abducting, trafficking, and extorting African migrants in the Sinai Peninsula, but the practice has reemerged along Egyptâ€™s western border with Libya","Tier 2 Watch List â€“ Egypt does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so; the government gathered data nationwide on trafficking cases to better allocate and prioritize anti-trafficking efforts, but overall it did not demonstrate increased progress; prosecutions increased in 2014, but no offenders were convicted for the second consecutive year; fewer trafficking victims were identified in 2014, which represents a significant and ongoing decrease from the previous two reporting periods; the government relied on NGOs and international organizations to identify and refer victims to protective services, and focused on Egyptian victims and refused to provide some services to foreign victims, at times including shelter (2015)",,,,,schistosomiasis (2016),,,,,,,,,,,,,"one of the largest and most famous libraries in the ancient world was the Great Library of Alexandria in Egypt (founded about 295 B.C., it may have survived in some form into the 5th century A.D.); seeking to resurrect the great center of learning and communication, the Egyptian Government in 2002 inaugurated the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, an Egyptian National Library on the site of the original Great Library, which commemorates the original archive and also serves as a center of cultural and scientific excellence",,,,,,,,"&lt;strong&gt;aim(s):&lt;/strong&gt; overthrow the Egyptian Government and, ultimately, establish a pan-Islamic caliphate under a strict Salafi Muslim interpretation of sharia&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;area(s) of operation:&lt;/strong&gt; maintains a longtime operational presence and established networks (2018)",,,,"Ain Sukhna terminal, Sidi Kerir terminal",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"&lt;strong&gt;aim(s):&lt;/strong&gt; overthrow the Egyptian Government&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;area(s) of operation:&lt;/strong&gt; Cairo, Nile Delta, Western Desert (2018)","&lt;strong&gt;aim(s):&lt;/strong&gt; spread the ISIS caliphate by eliminating the Egyptian Government, destroying Israel, and establishing an Islamic emirate in the Sinai&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;area(s) of operation:&lt;/strong&gt; operations are based out of the Sinai Peninsula, but its reach extends to Cairo, the Egyptian Nile Valley, and Gaza; operations mainly target Egyptian security forces, but also include attacks on civilians, as well as kidnappings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;note:&lt;/strong&gt; formerly known as Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis; core ISIS refers to Egypt as its Wilayat Sinai (2018)","&lt;strong&gt;aim(s):&lt;/strong&gt; overthrow the Egyptian Government&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;area(s) of operation:&lt;/strong&gt; Cairo, Monofeya, and Qalyubia governorates (2019)","&lt;strong&gt;aim(s): &lt;/strong&gt;disrupt the Egyptian Government&#39;s efforts to provide security and, ultimately, establish an Islamic caliphate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;area(s) of operation:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;operational mainly in Cairo and the Sinai Peninsula &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;note:&lt;/strong&gt; associated with ISIS-Sinai Province; targets Israeli Government interests, sometimes in collaboration with the Mujahidin Shura Council in the Environs of Jerusalem (2018)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERI,Eritrea,ER,17-Dec-19,"After independence from Italian colonial control in 1941 and 10 years of British administrative control, the UN established Eritrea as an autonomous region within the Ethiopian federation in 1952. Ethiopia&#39;s full annexation of Eritrea as a province 10 years later sparked a violent 30-year struggle for independence that ended in 1991 with Eritrean rebels defeating government forces. Eritreans overwhelmingly approved independence in a 1993 referendum. ISAIAS Afwerki has been Eritrea&#39;s only president since independence; his rule, particularly since 2001, has been highly autocratic and repressive. His government has created a highly militarized society by pursuing an unpopular program of mandatory conscription into national service &amp;ndash; divided between military and civilian service &amp;ndash; of indefinite length. A two-and-a-half-year border war with Ethiopia that erupted in 1998 ended under UN auspices in December 2000. A UN peacekeeping operation was established that monitored a 25 km-wide Temporary Security Zone. The Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission (EEBC) created in April 2003 was tasked &quot;to delimit and demarcate the colonial treaty border based on pertinent colonial treaties (1900, 1902, and 1908) and applicable international law.&quot; The EEBC on 30 November 2007 remotely demarcated the border, assigning the town of Badme to Eritrea, despite Ethiopia&#39;s maintaining forces there from the time of the 1998-2000 war. Eritrea insisted that the UN terminate its peacekeeping mission on 31 July 2008. More than a decade of a tense &amp;ldquo;no peace, no war&amp;rdquo; stalemate ended in 2018 after the newly elected Ethiopian Prime Minister accepted the EEBC&amp;rsquo;s 2007 ruling, and the two countries signed declarations of peace and friendship in July and September. Following the July 2018 peace agreement with Ethiopia, Eritrean leaders engaged in intensive diplomacy around the Horn of Africa, bolstering regional peace, security, and cooperation, as well as brokering rapprochements between governments and opposition groups. In November 2018, the UN Security Council lifted an arms embargo that had been imposed on Eritrea since 2009, after the UN Somalia-Eritrea Monitoring Group reported they had not found evidence of Eritrean support in recent years for Al-Shabaab.","Eastern Africa, bordering the Red Sea, between Djibouti and Sudan","15 00 N, 39 00 E",Africa,"117,600 sq km","101,000 sq km","16,600 sq km",slightly smaller than Pennsylvania,"1,840 km","Djibouti 125 km, Ethiopia 1033 km, Sudan 682 km","2,234 km (mainland on Red Sea 1,151 km, islands in Red Sea 1,083 km)",,,,,"hot, dry desert strip along Red Sea coast;

Eritrea has a command economy under the control of the sole political party, the People&#39;s Front for Democracy and Justice. Like the economies of many African nations, a large share of the population - nearly 80% in Eritrea - is engaged in subsistence agriculture, but the sector only produces a small share of the country&#39;s total output. Mining accounts for the lion&#39;s share of output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government has strictly controlled the use of foreign currency by limiting access and availability; new regulations in 2013 aimed at relaxing currency controls have had little economic effect. Few large private enterprises exist in Eritrea and most operate in conjunction with government partners, including a number of large international mining ventures, which began production in 2013. In late 2015, the Government of Eritrea introduced a new currency, retaining the name nakfa, and restricted the amount of hard currency individuals could withdraw from banks per month. The changeover has resulted in exchange fluctuations and the scarcity of hard currency available in the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While reliable statistics on Eritrea are difficult to obtain, erratic rainfall and the large percentage of the labor force tied up in military service continue to interfere with agricultural production and economic development. Eritrea&#39;s harvests generally cannot meet the food needs of the country without supplemental grain purchases. Copper, potash, and gold production are likely to continue to drive limited economic growth and government revenue over the next few years, but military spending will continue to compete with development and investment plans.&lt;/p&gt;",$9.402 billion,$5.813 billion (2017 est.),5%,"$1,600 ",5.5% of GDP,80.9% (2017 est.),24.3% (2017 est.),6.4% (2017 est.),0.1% (2017 est.),10.9% (2017 est.),-22.5% (2017 est.),11.7% (2017 est.),29.6% (2017 est.),58.7% (2017 est.),"sorghum, lentils, vegetables, corn, cotton, tobacco, sisal; livestock, goats; fish","food processing, beverages, clothing and textiles, light manufacturing, salt, cement",5.4% (2017 est.),2.71 million (2017 est.),80%,20% (2004 est.),,5.80%,50% (2004 est.), NA, NA,2.029 billion (2017 est.),2.601 billion (2017 est.),34.9% (of GDP) (2017 est.),-9.8% (of GDP) (2017 est.),131.2% of GDP,calendar year,9%,,&lt;p&gt;NA&lt;/p&gt;,$2.734 billion,$2.734 billion,$5.223 billion,,-$137 million,$624.3 million,"China 62%, South Korea 28.3% (2017)","gold and other minerals, livestock, sorghum, textiles, food, small industry manufactures",$1.127 billion,"machinery, petroleum products, food, manufactured goods","UAE 14.5%, China 13.2%, Saudi Arabia 13.2%, Italy 12.9%, Turkey 5.6%, South Africa 4.6% (2017)",$218.4 million,$875.6 million,,,nakfa (ERN) per US dollar -,,415.9 million kWh (2016 est.),353.9 million kWh (2016 est.),0 kWh (2016 est.),0 kWh (2016 est.),"160,700 kW (2016 est.)",99% of total installed capacity (2016 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),1% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),0 bbl/day (2018 est.),0 bbl/day (2015 est.),0 bbl/day (2015 est.),0 bbl (1 January 2018 est.),0 bbl/day (2015 est.),"4,000 bbl/day (2016 est.)",0 bbl/day (2015 est.),"3,897 bbl/day (2015 est.)",0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (1 January 2014 est.),"597,100 Mt (2017 est.)","66,086",1 (July 2016 est.),"506,000",9 (July 2016 est.),woefully inadequate service provided by state-owned telecom monopoly; most fixed-line telephones are in Asmara; cell phone use is limited by government control of SIM card issuance; no data service; only about 3% of households having computers with 2% Internet; untapped market ripe for competition; direct phone service between Eritrea and Ethiopia&amp;nbsp;was restored in September 2018; government telco working on roll-out of 3G network (2018),fixed-line&amp;nbsp;subscribership is less than 1 per 100 person and mobile-cellular 9 per 100 (2018),country code - 291 (2019),government controls broadcast media with private ownership prohibited; 1 state-owned TV station; state-owned radio operates 2 networks; purchases of satellite dishes and subscriptions to international broadcast media are permitted (2019),.er,"69,095",1.2% (July 2016 est.),600, less than 1 (2017 est.),,"Eritrean Defense Forces: Eritrean Ground Forces, Eritrean Navy, Eritrean Air Force (includes Air Defense Force) (2019)",18-40 years of age for male and female voluntary and compulsory military service; 18-month conscript service obligation (2019),1 (2015),1 (2015),,,E3 (2016),13 (2013),4 (2019),2,2,,,,9 (2013),1 (2013),1 (2013),5 (2013),2 (2013),,1 (2013),,"16,000 km (2018)","1,600 km (2000)",9,"general cargo 4, oil tanker 1, other 4 (2018)",,,,"&lt;p&gt;Eritrea and Ethiopia agreed to abide by 2002 Ethiopia-Eritrea Boundary Commission&#39;s (EEBC) delimitation decision, but neither party responded to the revised line detailed in the November 2006 EEBC Demarcation Statement; Sudan accuses Eritrea of supporting eastern Sudanese rebel groups; in 2008, Eritrean troops moved across the border on Ras Doumera peninsula and occupied Doumera Island with undefined sovereignty in the Red Sea&lt;/p&gt;",,21.3 years (2010 est.),8.4% (2010),high (2016),"bacterial diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever (2016)",malaria and dengue fever (2016),39.4% (2010),,,,3 million (2017),46.7% (2016),74.6% (2016),39.3% (2016),,"14,400 km (2000)",,"Assab, Massawa",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"&lt;p&gt;Eritrea is a persistently poor country that has made progress in some socioeconomic categories but not in others. Education and human capital formation are national priorities for facilitating economic development and eradicating poverty. To this end, Eritrea has made great strides in improving adult literacy â€“ doubling the literacy rate over the last 20 years â€“ in large part because of its successful adult education programs. The overall literacy rate was estimated to be almost 74% in 2015; more work needs to be done to raise female literacy and school attendance among nomadic and rural communities. Subsistence farming fails to meet the needs of Eritreaâ€™s growing population because of repeated droughts, dwindling arable land, overgrazing, soil erosion, and a shortage of farmers due to conscription and displacement. The governmentâ€™s emphasis on spending on defense over agriculture and its lack of foreign exchange to import food also contribute to food insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eritrea has been a leading refugee source country since at least the 1960s, when its 30-year war for independence from Ethiopia began. Since gaining independence in 1993, Eritreans have continued migrating to Sudan, Ethiopia, Yemen, Egypt, or Israel because of a lack of basic human rights or political freedom, educational and job opportunities, or to seek asylum because of militarization. Eritreaâ€™s large diaspora has been a source of vital remittances, funding its war for independence and providing 30% of the countryâ€™s GDP annually since it became independent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last few years, Eritreans have increasingly been trafficked and held hostage by Bedouins in the Sinai Desert, where they are victims of organ harvesting, rape, extortion, and torture. Some Eritrean trafficking victims are kidnapped after being smuggled to Sudan or Ethiopia, while others are kidnapped from within or around refugee camps or crossing Eritreaâ€™s borders.

ETH,Ethiopia,ET,17-Dec-19,"Unique among African countries, the ancient Ethiopian monarchy maintained its freedom from colonial rule with the exception of a short-lived Italian occupation from 1936-41. In 1974, a military junta, the Derg, deposed Emperor Haile SELASSIE (who had ruled since 1930) and established a socialist state. Torn by bloody coups, uprisings, wide-scale drought, and massive refugee problems, the regime was finally toppled in 1991 by a coalition of rebel forces, the Ethiopian People&#39;s Revolutionary Democratic Front. A constitution was adopted in 1994, and Ethiopia&#39;s first multiparty elections were held in 1995. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A border war with Eritrea in the late 1990s ended with a peace treaty in December 2000. In November 2007, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Border Commission (EEBC) issued specific coordinates as virtually demarcating the border and pronounced its work finished. Alleging that the EEBC acted beyond its mandate in issuing the coordinates, Ethiopia did not accept them and maintained troops in previously contested areas pronounced by the EEBC as belonging to Eritrea. This intransigence resulted in years of heightened tension between the two countries. In August 2012, longtime leader Prime Minister MELES Zenawi died in office and was replaced by his Deputy Prime Minister HAILEMARIAM Desalegn, marking the first peaceful transition of power in decades. Following a wave of popular dissent and anti-government protest that began in 2015, HAILEMARIAM resigned in February 2018 and ABIY Ahmed Ali took office in April 2018 as Ethiopia&#39;s first ethnic Oromo prime minister. In June 2018, ABIY announced Ethiopia would accept the border ruling of 2000, prompting rapprochement between Ethiopia and Eritrea that was marked with a peace agreement in July 2018 and a reopening of the border in September 2018.","Eastern Africa, west of Somalia","8 00 N, 38 00 E",Africa,"1,104,300 sq km","1,096,570 sq km","7,730 sq km",slightly less than twice the size of Texas,"5,925 km","Djibouti 342 km, Eritrea 1033 km, Kenya 867 km, Somalia 1640 km, South Sudan 1299 km, Sudan 744 km",0 km (landlocked),,,,,tropical monsoon with wide topographic-induced variation,high plateau with central mountain range divided by Great Rift Valley,"1,330 m",Danakil Depression -125 m,"Ras Dejen 4,550 m","small reserves of gold, platinum, copper, potash, natural gas, hydropower",36.3% (2011 est.),15.2% (2011 est.),1.1% (2011 est.),20% (2011 est.),12.2% (2011 est.),51.5% (2011 est.),"2,900 sq km (2012)","highest density is found in the highlands of the north and middle areas of the country, particularly around the centrally located capital city of Addis Ababa;

More than 70% of Ethiopiaâ€™s population is still employed in the agricultural sector, but services have surpassed agriculture as the principal source of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethiopia has the lowest level of income-inequality in Africa and one of the lowest in the world, with a Gini coefficient comparable to that of the Scandinavian countries. Yet despite progress toward eliminating extreme poverty, Ethiopia remains one of the poorest countries in the world, due both to rapid population growth and a low starting base. Changes in rainfall associated with world-wide weather patterns resulted in the worst drought in 30 years in 2015-16, creating food insecurity for millions of Ethiopians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state is heavily engaged in the economy. Ongoing infrastructure projects include power production and distribution, roads, rails, airports and industrial parks. Key sectors are state-owned, including telecommunications, banking and insurance, and power distribution. Under Ethiopia&#39;s constitution, the state owns all land and provides long-term leases to tenants. Title rights in urban areas, particularly Addis Ababa, are poorly regulated, and subject to corruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethiopiaâ€™s foreign exchange earnings are led by the services sector - primarily the state-run Ethiopian Airlines - followed by exports of several commodities. While coffee remains the largest foreign exchange earner, Ethiopia is diversifying exports, and commodities such as gold, sesame, khat, livestock and horticulture products are becoming increasingly important. Manufacturing represented less than 8% of total exports in 2016, but manufacturing exports should increase in future years due to a growing international presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banking, insurance, telecommunications, and micro-credit industries are restricted to domestic investors, but Ethiopia has attracted roughly $8.5 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI), mostly from China, Turkey, India and the EU; US FDI is $567 million. Investment has been primarily in infrastructure, construction, agriculture/horticulture, agricultural processing, textiles, leather and leather products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support industrialization in sectors where Ethiopia has a comparative advantage, such as textiles and garments, leather goods, and processed agricultural products, Ethiopia plans to increase installed power generation capacity by 8,320 MW, up from a capacity of 2,000 MW, by building three more major dams and expanding to other sources of renewable energy. In 2017, the government devalued the birr by 15% to increase exports and alleviate a chronic foreign currency shortage in the country.&lt;/p&gt;",$200.6 billion,$80.87 billion (2017 est.),10.90%,"$2,200 ",32.1% of GDP,69.6% (2017 est.),10% (2017 est.),43.5% (2017 est.),-0.1% (2017 est.),8.1% (2017 est.),-31.2% (2017 est.),34.8% (2017 est.),21.6% (2017 est.),43.6% (2017 est.),"cereals, coffee, oilseed, cotton, sugarcane, vegetables, khat, cut flowers;

Infant, child, and maternal mortality have fallen sharply over the past decade, but the total fertility rate has declined more slowly and the population continues to grow. The rising age of marriage and the increasing proportion of women remaining single have contributed to fertility reduction. While the use of modern contraceptive methods among married women has increased significantly from 6 percent in 2000 to 27 percent in 2012, the overall rate is still quite low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethiopiaâ€™s rapid population growth is putting increasing pressure on land resources, expanding environmental degradation, and raising vulnerability to food shortages. With more than 40 percent of the population below the age of 15 and a fertility rate of over 5 children per woman (and even higher in rural areas), Ethiopia will have to make further progress in meeting its family planning needs if it is to achieve the age structure necessary for reaping a demographic dividend in the coming decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poverty, drought, political repression, and forced government resettlement have driven Ethiopiaâ€™s internal and external migration since the 1960s.

Between 1982 and 1991 there was a new wave of migration to the West for family reunification. Since the defeat of the Derg in 1991, Ethiopians have migrated to escape violence among some of the countryâ€™s myriad ethnic groups or to pursue economic opportunities.

It gained complete independence in 1917. During World War II, Finland successfully defended its independence through cooperation with Germany and resisted subsequent invasions by the Soviet Union - albeit with some loss of territory. In the subsequent half century, Finland transformed from a farm/forest economy to a diversified modern industrial economy; per capita income is among the highest in Western Europe. A member of the EU since 1995, Finland was the only Nordic state to join the euro single currency at its initiation in January 1999. In the 21st century, the key features of Finland&#39;s modern welfare state are high quality education, promotion of equality, and a national social welfare system - currently challenged by an aging population and the fluctuations of an export-driven economy.","Northern Europe, bordering the Baltic Sea, Gulf of Bothnia, and Gulf of Finland, between Sweden and Russia","64 00 N, 26 00 E",Europe,"338,145 sq km","303,815 sq km","34,330 sq km",slightly more than two times the size of Georgia;

Trade is important, with exports accounting for over one-third of GDP in recent years. The government is open to, and actively takes steps to attract, foreign direct investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finland is historically competitive in manufacturing, particularly in the wood, metals, engineering, telecommunications, and electronics industries. Finland excels in export of technology as well as promotion of startups in the information and communications technology, gaming, cleantech, and biotechnology sectors. Except for timber and several minerals, Finland depends on imports of raw materials, energy, and some components for manufactured goods. Because of the cold climate, agricultural development is limited to maintaining self-sufficiency in basic products. Forestry, an important export industry, provides a secondary occupation for the rural population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finland had been one of the best performing economies within the EU before 2009 and its banks and financial markets avoided the worst of global financial crisis. However, the world slowdown hit exports and domestic demand hard in that year, causing Finlandâ€™s economy to contract from 2012 to 2014. The recession affected general government finances and the debt ratio. The economy returned to growth in 2016, posting a 1.9% GDP increase before growing an estimated 3.3% in 2017, supported by a strong increase in investment, private consumption, and net exports. Finnish economists expect GDP to grow a rate of 2-3% in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finland&#39;s main challenges will be reducing high labor costs and boosting demand for its exports. In June 2016, the government enacted a Competitiveness Pact aimed at reducing labor costs, increasing hours worked, and introducing more flexibility into the wage bargaining system. As a result, wage growth was nearly flat in 2017. The Government was also seeking to reform the health care system and social services.

FJI,Fiji,FJ,26-Dec-19,"Fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a British colony. Democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the Indian community (descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the British in the 19th century). The coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native Melanesian control of Fiji led to heavy Indian emigration; the population loss resulted in economic difficulties, but ensured that Melanesians became the majority. A new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable. Free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an Indo-Fijian, but a civilian-led coup in 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil. Parliamentary elections held in 2001 provided Fiji with a democratically elected government led by Prime Minister Laisenia QARASE. Reelected in May 2006, QARASE was ousted in a December 2006 military coup led by Commodore Voreqe BAINIMARAMA, who initially appointed himself acting president but in January 2007 became interim prime minister. Following years of political turmoil, long-delayed legislative elections were held in September 2014 that were deemed &quot;credible&quot; by international observers and that resulted in BAINIMARAMA being reelected. He was reelected in November 2018 in elections deemed free and fair.","Oceania, island group in the South Pacific Ocean, about two-thirds of the way from Hawaii to New Zealand","18 00 S, 175 00 E",Oceania,"18,274 sq km","18,274 sq km",0 sq km,slightly smaller than New Jersey,,,"1,129 km",12 nm,200 nm,24 nm, 200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation,tropical marine;

FSM,"Micronesia, Federated States of",FM,18-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;The Caroline Islands are a widely scattered archipelago in the western Pacific Ocean; they became part of a UN Trust Territory under US administration following World War II. The eastern four island groups adopted a constitution in 1979 and chose to become the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). (The westernmost island group became Palau.) Independence came in 1986 under a Compact of Free Association (COFA) with the US, which was amended in 2004. The COFA has been a force for stability and democracy in the FSM since it came into force in 1986. Present concerns include economic uncertainty after 2023 when direct US economic assistance is scheduled to end, large-scale unemployment, overfishing, overdependence on US foreign aid, and state perceptions of inequitable allocation of US aid.&lt;/p&gt; As a signatory to the COFA with the US, eligible Micronesians can live, work, and study in any part of the US and its territories without a visa - this privilege reduces stresses on the island economy and the environment.

FRA,France,FR,31-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;France today is one of the most modern countries in the world and is a leader among European nations. It plays an influential global role as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, NATO, the G-7, the G-20, the EU, and other multilateral organizations. France rejoined NATO&#39;s integrated military command structure in 2009, reversing DE GAULLE&#39;s 1966 decision to withdraw French forces from NATO. Since 1958, it has constructed a hybrid presidential-parliamentary governing system resistant to the instabilities experienced in earlier, more purely parliamentary administrations. In recent decades, its reconciliation and cooperation with Germany have proved central to the economic integration of Europe, including the introduction of a common currency, the euro, in January 1999. In the early 21st century, five French overseas entities - French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, and Reunion - became French regions and were made part of France proper.&lt;/p&gt;","&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;metropolitan France:&lt;/strong&gt;

The government has partially or fully privatized many large companies, including Air France, France Telecom, Renault, and Thales. However, the government maintains a strong presence in some sectors, particularly power, public transport, and defense industries. France is the most visited country in the world with 89 million foreign tourists in 2017.

Meanwhile, France&#39;s public debt rose from 89.5% of GDP in 2012 to 97% in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since entering office in May 2017, President Emmanuel MACRON launched a series of economic reforms to improve competitiveness and boost economic growth. President MACRON campaigned on reforming Franceâ€™s labor code and in late 2017 implemented a range of reforms to increase flexibility in the labor market by making it easier for firms to hire and fire and simplifying negotiations between employers and employees. In addition to labor reforms, President MACRONâ€™s 2018 budget cuts public spending, taxes, and social security contributions to spur private investment and increase purchasing power.

GAB,"Gambia, The",GA,17-Dec-19,"The Gambia gained its independence from the UK in 1965. Geographically surrounded by Senegal, it formed a short-lived Confederation of Senegambia between 1982 and 1989. In 1991, the two nations signed a friendship and cooperation treaty, although tensions flared up intermittently during the regime of Yahya JAMMEH. JAMMEH led a military coup in 1994 that overthrew the president and banned political activity. A new constitution and presidential election in 1996, followed by parliamentary balloting in 1997, completed a nominal return to civilian rule. JAMMEH was elected president in all subsequent elections including most recently in late 2011. After 22 years of increasingly authoritarian rule, President JAMMEH was defeated in free and fair elections in December 2016. Due to The Gambia&amp;rsquo;s poor human rights record under JAMMEH, international development partners had distanced themselves, and substantially reduced aid to the country. These channels have now reopened under the administration of President Adama BARROW, who took office in January 2017. The US and The Gambia currently enjoy improved relations. US assistance to the country has supported military education and training programs, as well as various capacity building and democracy strengthening activities. &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;","Western Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean and Senegal","13 28 N, 16 34 W",Africa,"11,300 sq km","10,120 sq km","1,180 sq km",slightly less than twice the size of Delaware,749 km,Senegal 749 km,80 km,12 nm,,18 nm, extent not specified,"tropical;

The agricultural sector has untapped potential - less than half of arable land is cultivated and agricultural productivity is low. Small-scale manufacturing activity features the processing of cashews, groundnuts, fish, and hides. The Gambia&#39;s reexport trade accounts for almost 80% of goods exports and China has been its largest trade partner for both exports and imports for several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gambia has sparse natural resource deposits. It relies heavily on remittances from workers overseas and tourist receipts. Remittance inflows to The Gambia amount to about one-fifth of the countryâ€™s GDP. The Gambia&#39;s location on the ocean and proximity to Europe has made it one of the most frequented tourist destinations in West Africa, boosted by private sector investments in eco-tourism and facilities. Tourism normally brings in about 20% of GDP, but it suffered in 2014 from touristsâ€™ fears of Ebola virus in neighboring West African countries. Unemployment and underemployment remain high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economic progress depends on sustained bilateral and multilateral aid, on responsible government economic management, and on continued technical assistance from multilateral and bilateral donors. International donors and lenders were concerned about the quality of fiscal management under the administration of former President Yahya JAMMEH, who reportedly stole hundreds of millions of dollars of the countryâ€™s funds during his 22 years in power, but anticipate significant improvements under the new administration of President Adama BARROW, who assumed power in early 2017. As of April 2017, the IMF, the World Bank, the European Union, and the African Development Bank were all negotiating with the new government of The Gambia to provide financial support in the coming months to ease the countryâ€™s financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country faces a limited availability of foreign exchange, weak agricultural output, a border closure with Senegal, a slowdown in tourism, high inflation, a large fiscal deficit, and a high domestic debt burden that has crowded out private sector investment and driven interest rates to new highs.

The overall literacy rate is around 55%, and is significantly lower for women than for men. At least 70% of the populace are farmers who are reliant on rain-fed agriculture and cannot afford improved seeds and fertilizers. Crop failures caused by droughts between 2011 and 2013 have increased poverty, food shortages, and malnutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gambia is a source country for migrants and a transit and destination country for migrants and refugees. Since the 1980s, economic deterioration, drought, and high unemployment, especially among youths, have driven both domestic migration (largely urban) and migration abroad (legal and illegal). Emigrants are largely skilled workers, including doctors and nurses, and provide a significant amount of remittances. The top receiving countries for Gambian emigrants are Spain, the US, Nigeria, Senegal, and the UK. While the Gambia and Spain do not share historic, cultural, or trade ties, rural Gambians have migrated to Spain in large numbers because of its proximity and the availability of jobs in its underground economy (this flow slowed following the onset of Spainâ€™s late 2007 economic crisis).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gambiaâ€™s role as a host country to refugees is a result of wars in several of its neighboring West African countries. Since 2006, refugees from the Casamance conflict in Senegal have replaced their pattern of flight and return with permanent settlement in The Gambia, often moving in with relatives along the Senegal-Gambia border. The strain of providing for about 7,400 Casamance refugees has increased poverty among Gambian villagers.&lt;/p&gt;",,,,,,,,"The Gambia is a source and destination country for women and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking; Gambian women, girls, and, to a lesser extent, boys are exploited for prostitution and domestic servitude; women, girls, and boys from West African countries are trafficked to The Gambia for commercial sexual exploitation, particularly by European sex tourists; boys in some Koranic schools are forced into street vending or begging; some Gambian children have been identified as victims of forced labor in neighboring West African countries","Tier 3 â€“ The Gambia does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so; the government demonstrated minimal anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts, investigating one trafficking case but not prosecuting or convicting any offenders in 2014; authorities did not investigate, prosecute, or convict any government employees complicit in trafficking, although corruption was a serious problem; the government identified and repatriated 19 Gambian girls subjected to domestic servitude in Lebanon but did not identify or provide protective services to any trafficking victims in The Gambia; a government program continued to provide resources and financial support to 12 Koranic schools on the condition that their students were not forced to beg (2015)",,,,,schistosomiasis (2016),rabies (2016),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,meningococcal meningitis (2016),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

President BONGO introduced a nominal multiparty system and a new constitution in the early 1990s. However, allegations of electoral fraud during local elections in December 2002 and the presidential election in 2005 exposed the weaknesses of formal political structures in Gabon. Following President BONGO&#39;s death in 2009, a new election brought his son, Ali BONGO Ondimba, to power. Despite constrained political conditions, Gabon&#39;s small population, abundant natural resources, and considerable foreign support have helped make it one of the more stable African countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Ali BONGO Ondimbaâ€™s controversial August 2016 reelection sparked unprecedented opposition protests that resulted in the burning of the parliament building. The election was contested by the opposition after fraudulent results were flagged by international election observers.

Gabon relied on timber and manganese exports until oil was discovered offshore in the early 1970s. From 2010 to 2016, oil accounted for approximately 80% of Gabonâ€™s exports, 45% of its GDP, and 60% of its state budget revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabon faces fluctuating international prices for its oil, timber, and manganese exports. A rebound of oil prices from 2001 to 2013 helped growth, but declining production, as some fields passed their peak production, has hampered Gabon from fully realizing potential gains. GDP grew nearly 6% per year over the 2010-14 period, but slowed significantly from 2014 to just 1% in 2017 as oil prices declined. Low oil prices also weakened government revenue and negatively affected the trade and current account balances.

GHA,Ghana,GH,17-Dec-19,"Formed from the merger of the British colony of the Gold Coast and the Togoland trust territory, Ghana in 1957 became the first sub-Saharan country in colonial Africa to gain its independence. Ghana endured a series of coups before Lt. Jerry RAWLINGS took power in 1981 and banned political parties. After approving a new constitution and restoring multiparty politics in 1992, RAWLINGS won presidential elections in 1992 and 1996 but was constitutionally prevented from running for a third term in 2000. John KUFUOR of the opposition New Patriotic Party (NPP) succeeded him and was reelected in 2004. John Atta MILLS of the National Democratic Congress won the 2008 presidential election and took over as head of state, but he died in July 2012 and was constitutionally succeeded by his vice president, John Dramani MAHAMA, who subsequently won the December 2012 presidential election. In 2016, however, Nana Addo Dankwa AKUFO-ADDO of the NPP defeated MAHAMA, marking the third time that the Ghanaâ€™s presidency has changed parties since the return to democracy.","Western Africa, bordering the Gulf of Guinea, between Cote d&#39;Ivoire and Togo","8 00 N, 2 00 W",Africa,"238,533 sq km","227,533 sq km","11,000 sq km",slightly smaller than Oregon,"2,420 km","Burkina Faso 602 km, Cote d&#39;Ivoire 720 km, Togo 1098 km",539 km,12 nm,200 nm,24 nm,200 nm,tropical;

Ghana&#39;s economy was strengthened by a quarter century of relatively sound management, a competitive business environment, and sustained reductions in poverty levels, but in recent years has suffered the consequences of loose fiscal policy, high budget and current account deficits, and a depreciating currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agriculture accounts for about 20% of GDP and employs more than half of the workforce, mainly small landholders. Gold, oil, and cocoa exports, and individual remittances, are major sources of foreign exchange. Expansion of Ghanaâ€™s nascent oil industry has boosted economic growth, but the fall in oil prices since 2015 reduced by half Ghanaâ€™s oil revenue. Production at Jubilee, Ghana&#39;s first commercial offshore oilfield, began in mid-December 2010. Production from two more fields, TEN and Sankofa, started in 2016 and 2017 respectively. The countryâ€™s first gas processing plant at Atuabo is also producing natural gas from the Jubilee field, providing power to several of Ghanaâ€™s thermal power plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 2018, key economic concerns facing the government include the lack of affordable electricity, lack of a solid domestic revenue base, and the high debt burden. The AKUFO-ADDO administration has made some progress by committing to fiscal consolidation, but much work is still to be done. Ghana signed a $920 million extended credit facility with the IMF in April 2015 to help it address its growing economic crisis. The IMF fiscal targets require Ghana to reduce the deficit by cutting subsidies, decreasing the bloated public sector wage bill, strengthening revenue administration, boosting tax revenues, and improving the health of Ghanaâ€™s banking sector. Priorities for the new administration include rescheduling some of Ghanaâ€™s $31 billion debt, stimulating economic growth, reducing inflation, and stabilizing the currency.

Fertility remains higher in the northern region than the Greater Accra region. On average, desired fertility has remained stable for several years; urban dwellers want fewer children than rural residents. Increased life expectancy, due to better health care, nutrition, and hygiene, and reduced fertility have increased Ghanaâ€™s share of elderly persons; Ghanaâ€™s proportion of persons aged 60+ is among the highest in sub-Saharan Africa. Poverty has declined in Ghana, but it remains pervasive in the northern region, which is susceptible to droughts and floods and has less access to transportation infrastructure, markets, fertile farming land, and industrial centers. The northern region also has lower school enrollment, higher illiteracy, and fewer opportunities for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghana was a country of immigration in the early years after its 1957 independence, attracting labor migrants largely from Nigeria and other neighboring countries to mine minerals and harvest cocoa â€“ immigrants composed about 12% of Ghanaâ€™s population in 1960. In the late 1960s, worsening economic and social conditions discouraged immigration, and hundreds of thousands of immigrants, mostly Nigerians, were expelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the 1970s, severe drought and an economic downturn transformed Ghana into a country of emigration; neighboring Cote dâ€™Ivoire was the initial destination. Later, hundreds of thousands of Ghanaians migrated to Nigeria to work in its booming oil industry, but most were deported in 1983 and 1985 as oil prices plummeted. Many Ghanaians then turned to more distant destinations, including other parts of Africa, Europe, and North America, but the majority continued to migrate within West Africa. Since the 1990s, increased emigration of skilled Ghanaians, especially to the US and the UK, drained the country of its health care and education professionals.

European power struggles immersed Germany in two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century and left the country occupied by the victorious Allied powers of the US, UK, France, and the Soviet Union in 1945. With the advent of the Cold War, two German states were formed in 1949: the western Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the eastern German Democratic Republic (GDR). The democratic FRG embedded itself in key western economic and security organizations, the EC (now the EU) and NATO, while the communist GDR was on the front line of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. The decline of the USSR and the end of the Cold War allowed for German reunification in 1990. Since then, Germany has expended considerable funds to bring eastern productivity and wages up to western standards. In January 1999, Germany and 10 other EU countries introduced a common European exchange currency, the euro.&lt;/p&gt;","Central Europe, bordering the Baltic Sea and the North Sea, between the Netherlands and Poland, south of Denmark","51 00 N, 9 00 E",Europe,"357,022 sq km","348,672 sq km","8,350 sq km",three times the size of Pennsylvania;

Germany benefits from a highly skilled labor force, but, like its Western European neighbors, faces significant demographic challenges to sustained long-term growth. Low fertility rates and a large increase in net immigration are increasing pressure on the country&#39;s social welfare system and necessitate structural reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reforms launched by the government of Chancellor Gerhard SCHROEDER (1998-2005), deemed necessary to address chronically high unemployment and low average growth, contributed to strong economic growth and falling unemployment. These advances, as well as a government subsidized, reduced working hour scheme, help explain the relatively modest increase in unemployment during the 2008-09 recession - the deepest since World War II. The German Government introduced a minimum wage in 2015 that increased to $9.79 (8.84 euros) in January 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stimulus and stabilization efforts initiated in 2008 and 2009 and tax cuts introduced in Chancellor Angela MERKEL&#39;s second term increased Germany&#39;s total budget deficit - including federal, state, and municipal - to 4.1% in 2010, but slower spending and higher tax revenues reduced the deficit to 0.8% in 2011 and in 2017 Germany reached a budget surplus of 0.7%. A constitutional amendment approved in 2009 limits the federal government to structural deficits of no more than 0.35% of GDP per annum as of 2016, though the target was already reached in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the March 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, Chancellor Angela MERKEL announced in May 2011 that eight of the country&#39;s 17 nuclear reactors would be shut down immediately and the remaining plants would close by 2022. Germany plans to replace nuclear power largely with renewable energy, which accounted for 29.5% of gross electricity consumption in 2016, up from 9% in 2000.

GRC,Greece,GR,29-Dec-19,"Greece achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1830. During the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, it gradually added neighboring islands and territories, most with Greek-speaking populations. In World War II, Greece was first invaded by Italy (1940) and subsequently occupied by Germany (1941-44); fighting endured in a protracted civil war between supporters of the king and other anti-communist and communist rebels. Following the latter&#39;s defeat in 1949, Greece joined NATO in 1952. In 1967, a group of military officers seized power, establishing a military dictatorship that suspended many political liberties and forced the king to flee the country. In 1974 following the collapse of the dictatorship, democratic elections and a referendum created a parliamentary republic and abolished the monarchy. In 1981, Greece joined the EC (now the EU); it became the 12th member of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in 2001. Greece has suffered a severe economic crisis since late 2009, due to nearly a decade of chronic overspending and structural rigidities.&amp;nbsp;Beginning in&amp;nbsp;2010, Greece entered three bailout agreements - with the European Commission, the European Central Bank (ECB), the IMF, and&amp;nbsp;the third in 2015 with&amp;nbsp;the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) - worth in total about $300 billion.

Tourism provides 18% of GDP. Immigrants make up nearly one-fifth of the work force, mainly in agricultural and unskilled jobs. Greece is a major beneficiary of EU aid, equal to about 3.3% of annual GDP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Greek economy averaged growth of about 4% per year between 2003 and 2007, but the economy went into recession in 2009 as a result of the world financial crisis, tightening credit conditions, and Athens&#39; failure to address a growing budget deficit. By 2013, the economy had contracted 26%, compared with the pre-crisis level of 2007. Greece met the EU&#39;s Growth and Stability Pact budget deficit criterion of no more than 3% of GDP in 2007-08, but violated it in 2009, when the deficit reached 15% of GDP. Deteriorating public finances, inaccurate and misreported statistics, and consistent underperformance on reforms prompted major credit rating agencies to downgrade Greece&#39;s international debt rating in late 2009 and led the country into a financial crisis. Under intense pressure from the EU and international market participants, the government accepted a bailout program that called on Athens to cut government spending, decrease tax evasion, overhaul the civil-service, health-care, and pension systems, and reform the labor and product markets. Austerity measures reduced the deficit to 1.3% in 2017. Successive Greek governments, however, failed to push through many of the most unpopular reforms in the face of widespread political opposition, including from the country&#39;s powerful labor unions and the general public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 2010, a leading credit agency assigned Greek debt its lowest possible credit rating, and in May 2010, the IMF and euro-zone governments provided Greece emergency short- and medium-term loans worth $147 billion so that the country could make debt repayments to creditors. Greece, however, struggled to meet the targets set by the EU and the IMF, especially after Eurostat - the EU&#39;s statistical office - revised upward Greece&#39;s deficit and debt numbers for 2009 and 2010. European leaders and the IMF agreed in October 2011 to provide Athens a second bailout package of $169 billion. The second deal called for holders of Greek government bonds to write down a significant portion of their holdings to try to alleviate Greeceâ€™s government debt burden. However, Greek banks, saddled with a significant portion of sovereign debt, were adversely affected by the write down and $60 billion of the second bailout package was set aside to ensure the banking system was adequately capitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2014, the Greek economy began to turn the corner on the recession. Greece achieved three significant milestones: balancing the budget - not including debt repayments; issuing government debt in financial markets for the first time since 2010; and generating 0.7% GDP growth â€” the first economic expansion since 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the nascent recovery, widespread discontent with austerity measures helped propel the far-left Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA) party into government in national legislative elections in January 2015. Between January and July 2015, frustrations grew between the SYRIZA-led government and Greeceâ€™s EU and IMF creditors over the implementation of bailout measures and disbursement of funds. The Greek government began running up significant arrears to suppliers, while Greek banks relied on emergency lending, and Greeceâ€™s future in the euro zone was called into question. To stave off a collapse of the banking system, Greece imposed capital controls in June 2015, then became the first developed nation to miss a loan payment to the IMF, rattling international financial markets. Unable to reach an agreement with creditors, Prime Minister Alexios TSIPRAS held a nationwide referendum on 5 July on whether to accept the terms of Greeceâ€™s bailout, campaigning for the ultimately successful &quot;no&quot; vote. The TSIPRAS government subsequently agreed, however, to a new $96 billion bailout in order to avert Greeceâ€™s exit from the monetary bloc. On 20 August 2015, Greece signed its third bailout, allowing it to cover significant debt payments to its EU and IMF creditors and to ensure the banking sector retained access to emergency liquidity. The TSIPRAS government â€” which retook office on 20 September 2015 after calling new elections in late August â€” successfully secured disbursal of two delayed tranches of bailout funds. Despite the economic turmoil, Greek GDP did not contract as sharply as feared, boosted in part by a strong tourist season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Greece saw improvements in GDP and unemployment. Unfinished economic reforms, a massive non-performing loan problem, and ongoing uncertainty regarding the political direction of the country hold the economy back. Some estimates put Greeceâ€™s black market at 20- to 25% of GDP, as more people have stopped reporting their income to avoid paying taxes that, in some cases, have risen to 70% of an individualâ€™s gross income.&lt;/p&gt;",$299.3 billion,$200.7 billion (2017 est.),1.40%,"$27,800 ",10.9% of GDP,69.6% (2017 est.),20.1% (2017 est.),12.5% (2017 est.),-1% (2017 est.),33.4% (2017 est.),-34.7% (2017 est.),4.1% (2017 est.),16.9% (2017 est.),79.1% (2017 est.),"wheat, corn, barley, sugar beets, olives, tomatoes, wine, tobacco, potatoes; beef, dairy products","tourism, food and tobacco processing, textiles, chemicals, metal products; mining, petroleum",3.5% (2017 est.),4.769 million (2017 est.),12.60%,15%,72.4% (30 October 2015 est.),21.50%,36% (2014 est.),1.70%,26.7% (2015 est.),97.99 billion (2017 est.),96.35 billion (2017 est.),48.8% (of GDP) (2017 est.),0.8% (of GDP) (2017 est.),181.8% of GDP,calendar year,1.10%,0.15%,5.62%,$86.53 billion,$86.53 billion,$231.4 billion,$82.59 billion,-$1.596 billion,$31.54 billion,"Italy 10.6%, Germany 7.1%, Turkey 6.8%, Cyprus 6.5%, Bulgaria 4.9%, Lebanon 4.3% (2017)","food and beverages, manufactured goods, petroleum products, chemicals, textiles",$52.27 billion,"machinery, transport equipment, fuels, chemicals","Germany 10.4%, Italy 8.2%, Russia 6.8%, Iraq 6.3%, South Korea 6.1%, China 5.4%, Netherlands 5.3%, France 4.3% (2017)",$6.026 billion,$468.2 billion,$30.8 billion,$32.91 billion,euros (EUR) per US dollar -,100% (2016),52.05 billion kWh (2016 est.),56.89 billion kWh (2016 est.),1.037 billion kWh (2016 est.),9.833 billion kWh (2016 est.),19.17 million kW (2016 est.),57% of total installed capacity (2016 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),14% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),29% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),"4,100 bbl/day (2018 est.)","3,229 bbl/day (2017 est.)","484,300 bbl/day (2017 est.)",10 million bbl (1 January 2018 est.),"655,400 bbl/day (2017 est.)","304,100 bbl/day (2017 est.)","371,900 bbl/day (2017 est.)","192,200 bbl/day (2017 est.)",8 million cu m (2017 est.),4.927 billion cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),4.984 billion cu m (2017 est.),991.1 million cu m (1 January 2018 est.),69.37 million Mt (2017 est.),"5,176,475",48 (2017 est.),"12,937,106",120 (2017 est.),"adequate, modern networks reach all areas; good mobile telephone and international service; 3 mobile network operators; 2019 5G trials and LTE use; despite rough economic conditions broadband penetration developing (2018)",microwave radio relay trunk system; extensive open-wire connections; submarine cable to offshore islands; 48 per 100 for fixed-line and 120 per 100 for mobile-cellular (2018),"country code - 30; landing points for the SEA-ME-WE-3, Adria-1, Italy-Greece 1, OTEGLOBE, MedNautilus Submarine System, Aphrodite 2, AAE-1&amp;nbsp;and Silphium optical telecommunications submarine cable that provides links to Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Southeast Asia, Asia and Australia;&amp;nbsp; tropospheric scatter; satellite earth stations - 4 (2 Intelsat - 1 Atlantic Ocean and 1 Indian Ocean, 1 Eutelsat, and 1 Inmarsat - Indian Ocean region) (2019)","broadcast media dominated by the private sector; roughly 150 private TV channels, about 10 of which broadcast nationwide; 1 government-owned terrestrial TV channel with national coverage; 3 privately owned satellite channels; multi-channel satellite and cable TV services available; upwards of 1,500 radio stations, all of them privately owned; government-owned broadcaster has 2 national radio stations",.gr,"7,443,016",69.1% (July 2016 est.),"3,778,263",35 (2017 est.),2.28% of GDP,"Hellenic Armed Forces:&amp;nbsp; Hellenic Army (Ellinikos Stratos, ES; includes National Guard reserves), Hellenic Navy (Elliniko Polemiko Navtiko, EPN), Hellenic Air Force (Elliniki Polemiki Aeroporia, EPA; includes air defense).

The agricultural sector accounts for 13.5% of GDP and 31% of the labor force; key agricultural exports include sugar, coffee, bananas, and vegetables. Guatemala is the top remittance recipient in Central America as a result of Guatemala&#39;s large expatriate community in the US.

The Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) entered into force in July 2006, spurring increased investment and diversification of exports, with the largest increases in ethanol and non-traditional agricultural exports. While CAFTA-DR has helped improve the investment climate, concerns over security, the lack of skilled workers, and poor infrastructure continue to hamper foreign direct investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distribution of income remains highly unequal with the richest 20% of the population accounting for more than 51% of Guatemala&#39;s overall consumption.

GUY,Guyana,GY,17-Dec-19,"Originally a Dutch colony in the 17th century, by 1815 Guyana had become a British possession. The abolition of slavery led to settlement of urban areas by former slaves and the importation of indentured servants from India to work the sugar plantations. The resulting ethnocultural divide has persisted and has led to turbulent politics. Guyana achieved independence from the UK in 1966, and since then it has been ruled mostly by socialist-oriented governments. In 1992, Cheddi JAGAN was elected president in what is considered the country&#39;s first free and fair election since independence. After his death five years later, his wife, Janet JAGAN, became president but resigned in 1999 due to poor health. Her successor, Bharrat JAGDEO, was elected in 2001 and again in 2006. Early elections held in May 2015 resulted in the first change in governing party and the replacement of President Donald RAMOTAR by current President David GRANGER. After a December 2018 no-confidence vote against the GRANGER government, national elections will be held before the scheduled spring 2020 date.","Northern South America, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between Suriname and Venezuela","5 00 N, 59 00 W",South America,"214,969 sq km","196,849 sq km","18,120 sq km",slightly smaller than Idaho;

The economy is heavily dependent upon the export of six commodities - sugar, gold, bauxite, shrimp, timber, and rice - which represent nearly 60% of the country&#39;s GDP and are highly susceptible to adverse weather conditions and fluctuations in commodity prices. Guyana closed or consolidated several sugar estates in 2017, reducing production of sugar to a forecasted 147,000 tons in 2018, less than half of 2017 production. Much of Guyana&#39;s growth in recent years has come from a surge in gold production. With a record-breaking 700,000 ounces of gold produced in 2016, Gold production in Guyana has offset the economic effects of declining sugar production. In January 2018, estimated 3.2 billion barrels of oil were found offshore and Guyana is scheduled to become a petroleum producer by March 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guyana&#39;s entrance into the Caricom Single Market and Economy in January 2006 broadened the country&#39;s export market, primarily in the raw materials sector. Guyana has experienced positive growth almost every year over the past decade. Inflation has been kept under control. Recent years have seen the government&#39;s stock of debt reduced significantly - with external debt now less than half of what it was in the early 1990s. Despite these improvements, the government is still juggling a sizable external debt against the urgent need for expanded public investment. In March 2007, the Inter-American Development Bank, Guyana&#39;s principal donor, canceled Guyana&#39;s nearly $470 million debt, equivalent to 21% of GDP, which along with other Highly Indebted Poor Country debt forgiveness, brought the debt-to-GDP ratio down from 183% in 2006 to 52% in 2017. Guyana had become heavily indebted as a result of the inward-looking, state-led development model pursued in the 1970s and 1980s.

Guyana&#39;s two largest ethnic groups are the Afro-Guyanese (descendants of African slaves) and the Indo-Guyanese (descendants of Indian indentured laborers), which together comprise about three quarters of Guyana&#39;s population. Tensions periodically have boiled over between the two groups, which back ethnically based political parties and vote along ethnic lines. Poverty reduction has stagnated since the late 1990s. About one-third of the Guyanese population lives below the poverty line; indigenous people are disproportionately affected. Although Guyana&#39;s literacy rate is reported to be among the highest in the Western Hemisphere, the level of functional literacy is considerably lower, which has been attributed to poor education quality, teacher training, and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guyana&#39;s emigration rate is among the highest in the world - more than 55% of its citizens reside abroad - and it is one of the largest recipients of remittances relative to GDP among Latin American and Caribbean counties. Although remittances are a vital source of income for most citizens, the pervasive emigration of skilled workers deprives Guyana of professionals in healthcare and other key sectors. More than 80% of Guyanese nationals with tertiary level educations have emigrated.

Hong Kong has no tariffs on imported goods, and it levies excise duties on only four commodities, whether imported or produced locally: hard alcohol, tobacco, oil, and methyl alcohol. There are no quotas or dumping laws. Hong Kong continues to link its currency closely to the US dollar, maintaining an arrangement established in 1983.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excess liquidity, low interest rates and a tight housing supply have caused Hong Kong property prices to rise rapidly. The lower and middle-income segments of the population increasingly find housing unaffordable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong&#39;s open economy has left it exposed to the global economic situation. Its continued reliance on foreign trade and investment makes it vulnerable to renewed global financial market volatility or a slowdown in the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mainland China has long been Hong Kong&#39;s largest trading partner, accounting for about half of Hong Kong&#39;s total trade by value. Hong Kong&#39;s natural resources are limited, and food and raw materials must be imported. As a result of China&#39;s easing of travel restrictions, the number of mainland tourists to the territory surged from 4.5 million in 2001 to 47.3 million in 2014, outnumbering visitors from all other countries combined. After peaking in 2014, overall tourist arrivals dropped 2.5% in 2015 and 4.5% in 2016. The tourism sector rebounded in 2017, with visitor arrivals rising 3.2% to 58.47 million. Travelers from Mainland China totaled 44.45 million, accounting for 76% of the total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong Government is promoting the Special Administrative Region (SAR) as the preferred business hub for renminbi (RMB) internationalization. Hong Kong residents are allowed to establish RMB-denominated savings accounts, RMB-denominated corporate and Chinese government bonds have been issued in Hong Kong, RMB trade settlement is allowed, and investment schemes such as the Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) Program was first launched in Hong Kong. Offshore RMB activities experienced a setback, however, after the Peopleâ€™s Bank of China changed the way it set the central parity rate in August 2015. RMB deposits in Hong Kong fell from 1.0 trillion RMB at the end of 2014 to 559 billion RMB at the end of 2017, while RMB trade settlement handled by banks in Hong Kong also shrank from 6.8 trillion RMB in 2015 to 3.9 trillion RMB in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong has also established itself as the premier stock market for Chinese firms seeking to list abroad. In 2015, mainland Chinese companies constituted about 50% of the firms listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and accounted for about 66% of the exchange&#39;s market capitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the past decade, as Hong Kong&#39;s manufacturing industry moved to the mainland, its service industry has grown rapidly. In 2014, Hong Kong and China signed a new agreement on achieving basic liberalization of trade in services in Guangdong Province under the Closer Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), adopted in 2003 to forge closer ties between Hong Kong and the mainland. The new measures, which took effect in March 2015, cover a negative list and a most-favored treatment provision. On the basis of the Guangdong Agreement, the Agreement on Trade in Services signed in November 2015 further enhanced liberalization, including extending the implementation of the majority of Guangdong pilot liberalization measures to the whole Mainland, reducing the restrictive measures in the negative list, and adding measures in the positive lists for cross-border services as well as cultural and telecommunications services. In June 2017, the Investment Agreement and the Agreement on Economic and Technical Cooperation (Ecotech Agreement) were signed under the framework of CEPA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kongâ€™s economic integration with the mainland continues to be most evident in the banking and finance sector. Initiatives like the Hong Kong-Shanghai Stock Connect, the Hong Kong- Shenzhen Stock Connect the Mutual Recognition of Funds, and the Bond Connect scheme are all important steps towards opening up the Mainlandâ€™s capital markets and have reinforced Hong Kongâ€™s role as Chinaâ€™s leading offshore RMB market. Additional connect schemes such as ETF Connect (for exchange-traded fund products) are also under exploration by Hong Kong authorities.

Although Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, it took four years of sporadic, but often bitter, fighting before occupying Yugoslav forces, dominated by Serb officers, were mostly cleared from Croatian lands, along with a majority of Croatia&#39;s ethnic Serb population.

The country&#39;s output during that time collapsed, and Croatia missed the early waves of investment in Central and Eastern Europe that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall. Between 2000 and 2007, however, Croatia&#39;s economic fortunes began to improve with moderate but steady GDP growth between 4% and 6%, led by a rebound in tourism and credit-driven consumer spending. Inflation over the same period remained tame and the currency, the kuna, stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Croatia experienced an abrupt slowdown in the economy in 2008; economic growth was stagnant or negative in each year between 2009 and 2014, but has picked up since the third quarter of 2014, ending 2017 with an average of 2.8% growth. Challenges remain including uneven regional development, a difficult investment climate, an inefficient judiciary, and loss of educated young professionals seeking higher salaries elsewhere in the EU. In 2016, Croatia revised its tax code to stimulate growth from domestic consumption and foreign investment. Income tax reduction began in 2017, and in 2018 various business costs were removed from income tax calculations. At the start of 2018, the government announced its economic reform plan, slated for implementation in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourism is one of the main pillars of the Croatian economy, comprising 19.6% of Croatiaâ€™s GDP. Croatia is working to become a regional energy hub, and is undertaking plans to open a floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) regasification terminal by the end of 2019 or early in 2020 to import LNG for re-distribution in southeast Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Croatia joined the EU on July 1, 2013, following a decade-long accession process. Croatia has developed a plan for Eurozone accession, and the government projects Croatia will adopt the Euro by 2024. In 2017, the Croatian government decreased public debt to 78% of GDP, from an all-time high of 84% in 2014, and realized a 0.8% budget surplus - the first surplus since independence in 1991. The government has also sought to accelerate privatization of non-strategic assets with mixed success. Croatiaâ€™s economic recovery is still somewhat fragile; Croatiaâ€™s largest private company narrowly avoided collapse in 2017, thanks to a capital infusion from an American investor.

In 1956, a revolt and an announced withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact were met with a massive military intervention by Moscow. Under the leadership of Janos KADAR in 1968, Hungary began liberalizing its economy, introducing so-called &quot;Goulash Communism.&quot; Hungary held its first multiparty elections in 1990 and initiated a free market economy.

Budapest has implemented unorthodox economic policies to boost household consumption and has relied on EU-funded development projects to generate growth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Following the fall of communism in 1990, Hungary experienced a drop-off in exports and financial assistance from the former Soviet Union. Hungary embarked on a series of economic reforms, including privatization of state-owned enterprises and reduction of social spending programs, to shift from a centrally planned to a market-driven economy, and to reorient its economy towards trade with the West. These efforts helped to spur growth, attract investment, and reduce Hungary&amp;rsquo;s debt burden and fiscal deficits. Despite these reforms, living conditions for the average Hungarian initially deteriorated as inflation increased and unemployment reached double digits. Conditions slowly improved over the 1990s as the reforms came to fruition and export growth accelerated. Economic policies instituted during that decade helped position Hungary to join the European Union in 2004. Hungary has not yet joined the euro-zone. Hungary suffered a historic economic contraction as a result of the global economic slowdown in 2008-09 as export demand and domestic consumption dropped, prompting it to take an IMF-EU financial assistance package.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since 2010, the government has backpedaled on many economic reforms and taken a more populist approach towards economic management. The government has favored national industries and government-linked businesses through legislation, regulation, and public procurements. In 2011 and 2014, Hungary nationalized private pension funds, which squeezed financial service providers out of the system, but also helped Hungary curb its public debt and lower its budget deficit to below 3% of GDP, as subsequent pension contributions have been channeled into the state-managed pension fund. Hungary&amp;rsquo;s public debt (at 74.5% of GDP) is still high compared to EU peers in Central Europe. Real GDP growth has been robust in the past few years due to increased EU funding, higher EU demand for Hungarian exports, and a rebound in domestic household consumption. To further boost household consumption ahead of the 2018 election, the government embarked on a six-year phased increase to minimum wages and public sector salaries, decreased taxes on foodstuffs and services, cut the personal income tax from 16% to 15%, and implemented a uniform 9% business tax for small and medium-sized enterprises and large companies. Real GDP growth slowed in 2016 due to a cyclical decrease in EU funding, but increased to 3.8% in 2017 as the government pre-financed EU funded projects ahead of the 2018 election.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Systemic economic challenges include pervasive corruption, labor shortages driven by demographic declines and migration, widespread poverty in rural areas, vulnerabilities to changes in demand for exports, and a heavy reliance on Russian energy imports.&lt;/p&gt;",$289.6 billion,$139.2 billion (2017 est.),4%,"$29,600 ",25.7% of GDP,49.6% (2017 est.),20% (2017 est.),21.6% (2017 est.),1% (2017 est.),90.2% (2017 est.),-82.4% (2017 est.),3.9% (2017 est.),31.3% (2017 est.),64.8% (2017 est.),"wheat, corn, sunflower seed, potatoes, sugar beets; pigs, cattle, poultry, dairy products","mining, metallurgy, construction materials, processed foods, textiles, chemicals (especially pharmaceuticals), motor vehicles",7.4% (2017 est.),4.599 million (2017 est.),4.90%,30.30%,64.5% (2015 est.),4.20%,14.9% (2015 est.),3.30%,22.4% (2015),61.98 billion (2017 est.),64.7 billion (2017 est.),44.5% (of GDP) (2017 est.),-2% (of GDP) (2017 est.),73.6% of GDP,calendar year,2.40%,0.90%,2.09%,$55.48 billion,$55.48 billion,$69.76 billion,$17.69 billion,$4.39 billion,$98.74 billion,"Germany 27.7%, Romania 5.4%, Italy 5.1%, Austria 5%, Slovakia 4.8%, France 4.4%, Czech Republic 4.4%, Poland 4.3% (2017)","machinery and equipment (55.8%), other manufactures (32.7%), food products (6.8%), raw materials (2.4%), fuels and electricity (2.3%) (2017 est.)",$96.3 billion,"machinery and equipment 45.4%, other manufactures 34.3%, fuels and electricity 12.6%, food products 5.3%, raw materials 2.5% (2012)","Germany 26.2%, Austria 6.3%, China 5.9%, Poland 5.5%, Slovakia 5.3%, Netherlands 5%, Czech Republic 4.8%, Italy 4.7%, France 4% (2017)",$25.82 billion,$131.3 billion,$298.2 billion,$222.6 billion,forints (HUF) per US dollar -,100% (2016),30.22 billion kWh (2016 est.),39.37 billion kWh (2016 est.),5.24 billion kWh (2016 est.),17.95 billion kWh (2016 est.),8.639 million kW (2016 est.),64% of total installed capacity (2016 est.),22% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),1% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),13% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),"16,000 bbl/day (2018 est.)","2,713 bbl/day (2017 est.)","121,000 bbl/day (2017 est.)",24 million bbl (1 January 2018 est.),"152,400 bbl/day (2017 est.)","167,700 bbl/day (2017 est.)","58,720 bbl/day (2017 est.)","82,110 bbl/day (2017 est.)",1.812 billion cu m (2017 est.),10.39 billion cu m (2017 est.),3.52 billion cu m (2017 est.),13.37 billion cu m (2017 est.),6.598 billion cu m (1 January 2018 est.),51.28 million Mt (2017 est.),"3,131,598",32 (2017 est.),"12,030,940",122 (2017 est.),modern telephone system is digital and highly automated; trunk services are carried by fiber-optic cable and digital microwave radio relay; regulator preps for 5G spectrum auction in 2019 (2018),"competition among mobile-cellular service providers has led to a sharp increase in the use of mobile-cellular phones, 122 per 100,&amp;nbsp;and a decrease in the number of fixed-line connections, 32 per 100 persons (2018)","country code - 36; Hungary has fiber-optic cable connections with all neighboring countries; the international switch is in Budapest; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean regions), 1 Inmarsat, 1 very small aperture terminal (VSAT) system of ground terminals","mixed system of state-supported public service broadcast media and private broadcasters; the 5 publicly owned TV channels and the 2 main privately owned TV stations are the major national broadcasters; a large number of special interest channels; highly developed market for satellite and cable TV services with about two-thirds of viewers utilizing their services; 4 state-supported public-service radio networks; a large number of local stations including commercial, public service, nonprofit, and community radio stations; digital transition completed at the end of 2013; government-linked businesses have greatly consolidated ownership in broadcast and print media",.hu,"7,826,695",79.3% (July 2016 est.),"2,956,585",30 (2017 est.),1.21% of GDP,Hungarian Defense Forces: Ground Forces and Hungarian Air Force.

IDN,Indonesia,ID,19-Dec-19,"The Dutch began to colonize Indonesia in the early 17th century; Japan occupied the islands from 1942 to 1945. Indonesia declared its independence shortly before Japan&#39;s surrender, but it required four years of sometimes brutal fighting, intermittent negotiations, and UN mediation before the Netherlands agreed to transfer sovereignty in 1949. A period of sometimes unruly parliamentary democracy ended in 1957 when President SOEKARNO declared martial law and instituted &quot;Guided Democracy.&quot; After an abortive coup in 1965 by alleged communist sympathizers, SOEKARNO was gradually eased from power. From 1967 until 1998, President SUHARTO ruled Indonesia with his &quot;New Order&quot; government. After street protests toppled SUHARTO in 1998, free and fair legislative elections took place in 1999. Indonesia is now the world&#39;s third most populous democracy, the world&#39;s largest archipelagic state, and the world&#39;s largest Muslim-majority nation. Current issues include: alleviating poverty, improving education, preventing terrorism, consolidating democracy after four decades of authoritarianism, implementing economic and financial reforms, stemming corruption, reforming the criminal justice system, addressing climate change, and controlling infectious diseases, particularly those of global and regional importance. In 2005, Indonesia reached a historic peace agreement with armed separatists in Aceh, which led to democratic elections in Aceh in December 2006.

During the global financial crisis, Indonesia outperformed its regional neighbors and joined China and India as the only G20 members posting growth. Indonesiaâ€™s annual budget deficit is capped at 3% of GDP, and the Government of Indonesia lowered its debt-to-GDP ratio from a peak of 100% shortly after the Asian financial crisis in 1999 to 34% today. In May 2017 Standard &amp; Poorâ€™s became the last major ratings agency to upgrade Indonesiaâ€™s sovereign credit rating to investment grade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poverty and unemployment, inadequate infrastructure, corruption, a complex regulatory environment, and unequal resource distribution among its regions are still part of Indonesiaâ€™s economic landscape. President Joko WIDODO - elected in July 2014 â€“ seeks to develop Indonesiaâ€™s maritime resources and pursue other infrastructure development, including significantly increasing its electrical power generation capacity. Fuel subsidies were significantly reduced in early 2015, a move which has helped the government redirect its spending to development priorities. Indonesia, with the nine other ASEAN members, will continue to move towards participation in the ASEAN Economic Community, though full implementation of economic integration has not yet materialized.&lt;/p&gt;",$3.25 trillion,$1.015 trillion (2017 est.),5.10%,"$12,400 ",31.7% of GDP,57.3% (2017 est.),9.1% (2017 est.),32.1% (2017 est.),0.3% (2017 est.),20.4% (2017 est.),-19.2% (2017 est.),13.7% (2017 est.),41% (2017 est.),45.4% (2017 est.),"rubber and similar products, palm oil, poultry, beef, forest products, shrimp, cocoa, coffee, medicinal herbs, essential oil, fish and its similar products, and spices","petroleum and natural gas, textiles, automotive, electrical appliances, apparel, footwear, mining, cement, medical instruments and appliances, handicrafts, chemical fertilizers, plywood, rubber, processed food, jewelry, and tourism",4.1% (2017 est.),125 million (2016 est.),32%,21%,47% (2016 est.),5.40%,10.9% (2016 est.),3.40%,28.2% (2010),131.7 billion (2017 est.),159.6 billion (2017 est.),13% (of GDP) (2017 est.),-2.7% (of GDP) (2017 est.),28.8% of GDP,calendar year,3.80%,6.46%,11.89%,$92.11 billion,$92.11 billion,$397.7 billion,$353.3 billion,-$17.33 billion,$168.9 billion,"China 13.6%, US 10.6%, Japan 10.5%, India 8.4%, Singapore 7.6%, Malaysia 5.1%, South Korea 4.8% (2017)","mineral fuels, animal or vegetable fats (includes palm oil), electrical machinery, rubber, machinery and mechanical appliance parts",$150.1 billion,"mineral fuels, boilers, machinery, and mechanical parts, electric machinery, iron and steel, foodstuffs","China 23.2%, Singapore 10.9%, Japan 10%, Thailand 6%, Malaysia 5.6%, South Korea 5.3%, US 5.2% (2017)",$130.2 billion,$344.4 billion,$229.1 billion,$18.42 billion,Indonesian rupiah (IDR) per US dollar -,,235.4 billion kWh (2016 est.),213.4 billion kWh (2016 est.),0 kWh (2017 est.),693 million kWh (2016 est.),61.43 million kW (2016 est.),85% of total installed capacity (2016 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),9% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),6% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),"772,000 bbl/day (2018 est.)","302,300 bbl/day (2015 est.)","498,500 bbl/day (2015 est.)",3.31 billion bbl (1 January 2018 est.),"950,000 bbl/day (2015 est.)",1.601 million bbl/day (2016 est.),"79,930 bbl/day (2015 est.)","591,500 bbl/day (2015 est.)",72.09 billion cu m (2017 est.),42.32 billion cu m (2017 est.),29.78 billion cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),2.866 trillion cu m (1 January 2018 est.),540.7 million Mt (2017 est.),"11,172,021",4 (2017 est.),"458,923,202",176 (2017 est.),"domestic service includes an interisland microwave system, an HF radio police net, and a domestic satellite communications system;

IND,India,IN,19-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;The Indus Valley civilization, one of the world&#39;s oldest, flourished during the 3rd and 2nd millennia B.C. and extended into northwestern India. Aryan tribes from the northwest infiltrated the Indian subcontinent about 1500 B.C.; their merger with the earlier Dravidian inhabitants created the classical Indian culture. The Maurya Empire of the 4th and 3rd centuries B.C. - which reached its zenith under ASHOKA - united much of South Asia. The Golden Age ushered in by the Gupta dynasty (4th to 6th centuries A.D.) saw a flowering of Indian science, art, and culture. Islam spread across the subcontinent over a period of 700 years. In the 10th and 11th centuries, Turks and Afghans invaded India and established the Delhi Sultanate. In the early 16th century, the Emperor BABUR established the Mughal Dynasty, which ruled India for more than three centuries. European explorers began establishing footholds in India during the 16th century.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the 19th century, Great Britain had become the dominant political power on the subcontinent and India was seen as the &quot;Jewel in the Crown&quot; of the British Empire. The British Indian Army played a vital role in both World Wars. Years of nonviolent resistance to British rule, led by Mohandas GANDHI and Jawaharlal NEHRU, eventually resulted in Indian independence in 1947. Large-scale communal violence took place before and after the subcontinent partition into two separate states - India and Pakistan. The neighboring countries have fought three wars since independence, the last of which was in 1971 and resulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate nation of Bangladesh. India&#39;s nuclear weapons tests in 1998 emboldened Pakistan to conduct its own tests that same year. In November 2008, terrorists originating from Pakistan conducted a series of coordinated attacks in Mumbai, India&#39;s financial capital. India&#39;s economic growth following the launch of economic reforms in 1991, a massive youthful population, and a strategic geographic location have contributed to India&#39;s emergence as a regional and global power.

Slightly less than half of the workforce is in agriculture, but services are the major source of economic growth, accounting for nearly two-thirds of India&#39;s output but employing less than one-third of its labor force. India has capitalized on its large educated English-speaking population to become a major exporter of information technology services, business outsourcing services, and software workers. Nevertheless, per capita income remains below the world average. India is developing into an open-market economy, yet traces of its past autarkic policies remain. Economic liberalization measures, including industrial deregulation, privatization of state-owned enterprises, and reduced controls on foreign trade and investment, began in the early 1990s and served to accelerate the country&#39;s growth, which averaged nearly 7% per year from 1997 to 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India&#39;s economic growth slowed in 2011 because of a decline in investment caused by high interest rates, rising inflation, and investor pessimism about the government&#39;s commitment to further economic reforms and about slow world growth. Investorsâ€™ perceptions of India improved in early 2014, due to a reduction of the current account deficit and expectations of post-election economic reform, resulting in a surge of inbound capital flows and stabilization of the rupee. Growth rebounded in 2014 through 2016. Despite a high growth rate compared to the rest of the world, Indiaâ€™s government-owned banks faced mounting bad debt, resulting in low credit growth. Rising macroeconomic imbalances in India and improving economic conditions in Western countries led investors to shift capital away from India, prompting a sharp depreciation of the rupee through 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economy slowed again in 2017, due to shocks of &quot;demonetizaton&quot; in 2016 and introduction of GST in 2017. Since the election, the government has passed an important goods and services tax bill and raised foreign direct investment caps in some sectors, but most economic reforms have focused on administrative and governance changes, largely because the ruling party remains a minority in Indiaâ€™s upper house of Parliament, which must approve most bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India has a young population and corresponding low dependency ratio, healthy savings and investment rates, and is increasing integration into the global economy. However, long-term challenges remain significant, including: India&#39;s discrimination against women and girls, an inefficient power generation and distribution system, ineffective enforcement of intellectual property rights, decades-long civil litigation dockets, inadequate transport and agricultural infrastructure, limited non-agricultural employment opportunities, high spending and poorly targeted subsidies, inadequate availability of quality basic and higher education, and accommodating rural-to-urban migration.&lt;/p&gt;",$9.474 trillion,$2.602 trillion (2017 est.),6.70%,"$7,200 ",28.8% of GDP,59.1% (2017 est.),11.5% (2017 est.),28.5% (2017 est.),3.9% (2017 est.),19.1% (2017 est.),-22% (2017 est.),15.4% (2016 est.),23% (2016 est.),61.5% (2016 est.),"rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, lentils, onions, potatoes;

IRN,Iran,IR,31-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;Known as Persia until 1935, Iran became an Islamic republic in 1979 after the ruling monarchy was overthrown and Shah Mohammad Reza PAHLAVI was forced into exile. Conservative clerical forces led by Ayatollah Ruhollah KHOMEINI established a theocratic system of government with ultimate political authority vested in a learned religious scholar referred to commonly as the Supreme Leader who, according to the constitution, is accountable only to the Assembly of Experts (AOE) - a popularly elected 88-member body of clerics. US-Iranian relations became strained when a group of Iranian students seized the US Embassy in Tehran in November 1979 and held embassy personnel hostages until mid-January 1981. The US cut off diplomatic relations with Iran in April 1980. During the period 1980-88, Iran fought a bloody, indecisive war with Iraq that eventually expanded into the Persian Gulf and led to clashes between US Navy and Iranian military forces. Iran has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism and was subject to US, UN, and EU economic sanctions and export controls because of its continued involvement in terrorism and concerns over possible military dimensions of its nuclear program until Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) Implementation Day in 2016. The US began gradually re-imposing sanctions on Iran after the US withdrawal from JCPOA in May 2018. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Following the election of reformer Hojjat ol-Eslam Mohammad KHATAMI as president in 1997 and a reformist Majles (legislature) in 2000, a campaign to foster political reform in response to popular dissatisfaction was initiated. The movement floundered as conservative politicians, supported by the Supreme Leader, unelected institutions of authority like the Council of Guardians, and the security services reversed and blocked reform measures while increasing security repression. Starting with nationwide municipal elections in 2003 and continuing through Majles elections in 2004, conservatives reestablished control over Iran&#39;s elected government institutions, which culminated with the August 2005 inauguration of hardliner Mahmud AHMADI-NEJAD as president. His controversial reelection in June 2009 sparked nationwide protests over allegations of electoral fraud, but the protests were quickly suppressed. Deteriorating economic conditions due primarily to government mismanagement and international sanctions prompted at least two major economically based protests in July and October 2012, but Iran&#39;s internal security situation remained stable. President AHMADI-NEJAD&#39;s independent streak angered regime establishment figures, including the Supreme Leader, leading to conservative opposition to his agenda for the last year of his presidency, and an alienation of his political supporters. In June 2013 Iranians elected a centrist cleric Dr. Hasan Fereidun ROHANI to the presidency. He is a longtime senior member in the regime, but has made promises of reforming society and Iran&#39;s foreign policy. The UN Security Council has passed a number of resolutions calling for Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities and comply with its IAEA obligations and responsibilities, and in July 2015 Iran and the five permanent members, plus Germany (P5+1) signed the JCPOA under which Iran agreed to restrictions on its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Iran held elections in 2016 for the AOE and Majles, resulting in a conservative-controlled AOE and a Majles that many Iranians perceive as more supportive of the ROHANI administration than the previous, conservative-dominated body. ROHANI was reelected president in May 2017. Economic concerns once again led to nationwide protests in December 2017 and January 2018 but they were contained by Iran&#39;s security services. Additional widespread economic protests broke out in November 2019 in response to the raised price of subsidized gasoline.&lt;/p&gt;","Middle East, bordering the Gulf of Oman, the Persian Gulf, and the Caspian Sea, between Iraq and Pakistan","32 00 N, 53 00 E",Middle East,"1,648,195 sq km","1,531,595 sq km","116,600 sq km",almost 2.5 times the size of Texas;

The Iranian government directly owns and operates hundreds of state-owned enterprises and indirectly controls many companies affiliated with the country&#39;s security forces.

ISL,Israel,IS,26-Dec-19,"The State of Israel was declared in 1948, after Britain withdrew from its mandate of Palestine. The UN proposed partitioning the area into Arab and Jewish states, and Arab armies that rejected the UN plan were defeated. Israel was admitted as a member of the UN in 1949 and saw rapid population growth, primarily due to migration from Europe and the Middle East, over the following years. Israel fought wars against its Arab neighbors in 1967 and 1973, followed by peace treaties with Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994. Israel took control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the 1967 war, and subsequently administered those territories through military authorities. Israel and Palestinian officials signed a number of interim agreements in the 1990s that created an interim period of Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005. While the most recent formal efforts to negotiate final status issues occurred in 2013-2014, the US continues its efforts to advance peace. Immigration to Israel continues, with 28,600 new immigrants, mostly Jewish, in 2016. The Israeli economy has undergone a dramatic transformation in the last 25 years, led by cutting-edge, high-tech sectors. Offshore gas discoveries in the Mediterranean, most notably in the Tamar and Leviathan gas fields, place Israel at the center of a potential regional natural gas market. However, longer-term structural issues such as low labor force participation among minority populations, low workforce productivity, high costs for housing and consumer staples, and a lack of competition, remain a concern for many Israelis and an important consideration for Israeli politicians. Prime Minister Benjamin NETANYAHU has led the Israeli Government since 2009; he formed a center-right coalition following the 2015 elections. In December 2018 the Knesset voted to dissolve itself, leading to an election in April 2019. When that election failed to result in formation of a government, Israel held a second election in September 2019, which also failed to result in the formation of a government. On 11 December 2019, the Knesset voted to hold a third election on 2 March 2020.","Middle East, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Egypt and Lebanon","31 30 N, 34 45 E",Middle East,"21,937 sq km","21,497 sq km",440 sq km,slightly larger than New Jersey,"1,065 km","Egypt 206 km, Gaza Strip 59 km, Jordan 336 km (20 km are within the Dead Sea), Lebanon 107 km, Syria 79 km, West Bank 278 km",273 km,12 nm,,, to depth of exploitation,temperate;

Cut diamonds, high-technology equipment, and pharmaceuticals are among its leading exports. Its major imports include crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military equipment. Israel usually posts sizable trade deficits, which are offset by tourism and other service exports, as well as significant foreign investment inflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2004 and 2013, growth averaged nearly 5% per year, led by exports. The global financial crisis of 2008-09 spurred a brief recession in Israel, but the country entered the crisis with solid fundamentals, following years of prudent fiscal policy and a resilient banking sector. Israel&#39;s economy also weathered the 2011 Arab Spring because strong trade ties outside the Middle East insulated the economy from spillover effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slowing domestic and international demand and decreased investment resulting from Israelâ€™s uncertain security situation reduced GDP growth to an average of roughly 2.8% per year during the period 2014-17. Natural gas fields discovered off Israel&#39;s coast since 2009 have brightened Israel&#39;s energy security outlook. The Tamar and Leviathan fields were some of the world&#39;s largest offshore natural gas finds in the last decade. Political and regulatory issues have delayed the development of the massive Leviathan field, but production from Tamar provided a 0.8% boost to Israel&#39;s GDP in 2013 and a 0.3% boost in 2014. One of the most carbon intense OECD countries, Israel generates about 57% of its power from coal and only 2.6% from renewable sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Income inequality and high housing and commodity prices continue to be a concern for many Israelis. Israel&#39;s income inequality and poverty rates are among the highest of OECD countries, and there is a broad perception among the public that a small number of &quot;tycoons&quot; have a cartel-like grip over the major parts of the economy. Government officials have called for reforms to boost the housing supply and to increase competition in the banking sector to address these public grievances. Despite calls for reforms, the restricted housing supply continues to impact younger Israelis seeking to purchase homes. Tariffs and non-tariff barriers, coupled with guaranteed prices and customs tariffs for farmers kept food prices high in 2016. Private consumption is expected to drive growth through 2018, with consumers benefitting from low inflation and a strong currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the long term, Israel faces structural issues including low labor participation rates for its fastest growing social segments - the ultraorthodox and Arab-Israeli communities. Also, Israel&#39;s progressive, globally competitive, knowledge-based technology sector employs only about 8% of the workforce, with the rest mostly employed in manufacturing and services - sectors which face downward wage pressures from global competition.

ITA,Italy,IT,29-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;Italy became a nation-state in 1861 when the regional states of the peninsula, along with Sardinia and Sicily, were united under King Victor EMMANUEL II. An era of parliamentary government came to a close in the early 1920s when Benito MUSSOLINI established a Fascist dictatorship. His alliance with Nazi Germany led to Italy&#39;s defeat in World War II. A democratic republic replaced the monarchy in 1946 and economic revival followed. Italy is a charter member of NATO and the European Economic Community (EEC) and its subsequent successors the EC and the EU. It has been at the forefront of European economic and political unification, joining the Economic and Monetary Union in 1999. Persistent problems include sluggish economic growth, high youth and female unemployment, organized crime, corruption, and economic disparities between southern Italy and the more prosperous north.&lt;/p&gt;","Southern Europe, a peninsula extending into the central Mediterranean Sea, northeast of Tunisia","42 50 N, 12 50 E",Europe,"301,340 sq km","294,140 sq km","7,200 sq km",almost twice the size of Georgia;

The Italian economy is driven in large part by the manufacture of high-quality consumer goods produced by small and medium-sized enterprises, many of them family-owned. Italy also has a sizable underground economy, which by some estimates accounts for as much as 17% of GDP. These activities are most common within the agriculture, construction, and service sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Italy is the third-largest economy in the euro zone, but its exceptionally high public debt and structural impediments to growth have rendered it vulnerable to scrutiny by financial markets. Public debt has increased steadily since 2007, reaching 131% of GDP in 2017. Investor concerns about Italy and the broader euro-zone crisis eased in 2013, bringing down Italy&#39;s borrowing costs on sovereign government debt from euro-era records. The government still faces pressure from investors and European partners to sustain its efforts to address Italy&#39;s longstanding structural economic problems, including labor market inefficiencies, a sluggish judicial system, and a weak banking sector. Italyâ€™s economy returned to modest growth in late 2014 for the first time since 2011. In 2015-16, Italyâ€™s economy grew at about 1% each year, and in 2017 growth accelerated to 1.5% of GDP.

JAM,Jamaica,JM,17-Dec-19,"The island - discovered by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1494 - was settled by the Spanish early in the 16th century. The native Taino, who had inhabited Jamaica for centuries, were gradually exterminated and replaced by African slaves. England seized the island in 1655 and established a plantation economy based on sugar, cocoa, and coffee. The abolition of slavery in 1834 freed a quarter million slaves, many of whom became small farmers. Jamaica gradually increased its independence from Britain. In 1958 it joined other British Caribbean colonies in forming the Federation of the West Indies. Jamaica withdrew from the Federation in 1961 and gained full independence in 1962. Deteriorating economic conditions during the 1970s led to recurrent violence as rival gangs affiliated with the major political parties evolved into powerful organized crime networks involved in international drug smuggling and money laundering. Violent crime, drug trafficking, and poverty pose significant challenges to the government today. Nonetheless, many rural and resort areas remain relatively safe and contribute substantially to the economy.","Caribbean, island in the Caribbean Sea, south of Cuba","18 15 N, 77 30 W",Central America and the Caribbean,"10,991 sq km","10,831 sq km",160 sq km,about half the size of New Jersey;

Jamaica, however, has made steady progress in reducing its debt-to-GDP ratio from a high of almost 150% in 2012 to less than 110% in 2017, in close collaboration with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The current IMF Stand-By Agreement requires Jamaica to produce an annual primary surplus of 7%, in an attempt to reduce its debt burden below 60% by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economic growth reached 1.6% in 2016, but declined to 0.9% in 2017 after intense rainfall, demonstrating the vulnerability of the economy to weather-related events.

The country&#39;s long-time ruler, King HUSSEIN (1953-99), successfully navigated competing pressures from the major powers (US, USSR, and UK), various Arab states, Israel, and a large internal Palestinian population. Jordan lost the West Bank to Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War. King HUSSEIN in 1988 permanently relinquished Jordanian claims to the West Bank; in 1994 he signed a peace treaty with Israel. King ABDALLAH II, King HUSSEIN&#39;s eldest son, assumed the throne following his father&#39;s death in 1999. He has implemented modest political reforms, including the passage of a new electoral law in early 2016 and an effort to devolve some authority to governorate- and municipal-level councils following subnational elections in 2017. In 2016, the Islamic Action Front, which is the political arm of the Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood, returned to the National Assembly with 15 seats after boycotting the previous two elections in 2010 and 2013.","Middle East, northwest of Saudi Arabia, between Israel (to the west) and Iraq","31 00 N, 36 00 E",Middle East,"89,342 sq km","88,802 sq km",540 sq km,about three-quarters the size of Pennsylvania;

The global economic slowdown and regional turmoil contributed to slower growth from 2010 to 2017 - with growth averaging about 2.5% per year - and hurt export-oriented sectors, construction/real estate, and tourism. Since the onset of the civil war in Syria and resulting refugee crisis, one of Jordanâ€™s most pressing socioeconomic challenges has been managing the influx of approximately 660,000 UN-registered refugees, more than 80% of whom live in Jordanâ€™s urban areas. Jordanâ€™s own official census estimated the refugee number at 1.3 million Syrians as of early 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jordan is nearly completely dependent on imported energyâ€”mostly natural gasâ€”and energy consistently makes up 25-30% of Jordanâ€™s imports.

KEN,Kenya,KE,27-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;Founding president and liberation struggle icon Jomo KENYATTA led Kenya from independence in 1963 until his death in 1978, when Vice President Daniel Arap MOI took power in a constitutional succession. The country was a de facto one-party state from 1969 until 1982, after which time the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) changed the constitution to make itself the sole legal party in Kenya. MOI acceded to internal and external pressure for political liberalization in late 1991. The ethnically fractured opposition failed to dislodge KANU from power in elections in 1992 and 1997, which were marred by violence and fraud. President MOI stepped down in December 2002 following fair and peaceful elections. Mwai KIBAKI, running as the candidate of the multiethnic, united opposition group, the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC), defeated KANU candidate Uhuru KENYATTA, the son of founding president Jomo KENYATTA, and assumed the presidency following a campaign centered on an anticorruption platform.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KIBAKI&#39;s reelection in December 2007 brought charges of vote rigging from Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) candidate Raila ODINGA and unleashed two months of violence in which approximately 1,100 people died. African Union-sponsored mediation led by former UN Secretary General Kofi ANNAN in late February 2008 resulted in a power-sharing accord bringing ODINGA into the government in the restored position of prime minister. The power sharing accord included a broad reform agenda, the centerpiece of which was constitutional reform. In August 2010, Kenyans overwhelmingly adopted a new constitution in a national referendum. The new constitution introduced additional checks and balances to executive power and devolved power and resources to 47 newly created counties. It also eliminated the position of prime minister. Uhuru KENYATTA won the first presidential election under the new constitution in March 2013, and was sworn into office the following month; he began a second term in November 2017 following a contentious, repeat election.&lt;/p&gt;","Eastern Africa, bordering the Indian Ocean, between Somalia and Tanzania","1 00 N, 38 00 E",Africa,"580,367 sq km","569,140 sq km","11,227 sq km",five times the size of Ohio;

SENOGA-ZAKE","&lt;p&gt;Kenya is the economic, financial, and transport hub of East Africa. Kenyaâ€™s real GDP growth has averaged over 5% for the last decade. Since 2014, Kenya has been ranked as a lower middle income country because its per capita GDP crossed a World Bank threshold. While Kenya has a growing entrepreneurial middle class and steady growth, its economic development has been impaired by weak governance and corruption. Although reliable numbers are hard to find, unemployment and under-employment are extremely high, and could be near 40% of the population. In 2013, the country adopted a devolved system of government with the creation of 47 counties, and is in the process of devolving state revenues and responsibilities to the counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agriculture remains the backbone of the Kenyan economy, contributing one-third of GDP. About 75% of Kenyaâ€™s population of roughly 48.5 million work at least part-time in the agricultural sector, including livestock and pastoral activities. Over 75% of agricultural output is from small-scale, rain-fed farming or livestock production. Tourism also holds a significant place in Kenyaâ€™s economy. In spite of political turmoil throughout the second half of 2017, tourism was up 20%, showcasing the strength of this sector. Kenya has long been a target of terrorist activity and has struggled with instability along its northeastern borders. Some high visibility terrorist attacks during 2013-2015 (e.g., at Nairobiâ€™s Westgate Mall and Garissa University) affected the tourism industry severely, but the sector rebounded strongly in 2016-2017 and appears poised to continue growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inadequate infrastructure continues to hamper Kenyaâ€™s efforts to improve its annual growth so that it can meaningfully address poverty and unemployment. The KENYATTA administration has been successful in courting external investment for infrastructure development. International financial institutions and donors remain important to Kenya&#39;s growth and development, but Kenya has also successfully raised capital in the global bond market issuing its first sovereign bond offering in mid-2014, with a second occurring in February 2018. The first phase of a Chinese-financed and constructed standard gauge railway connecting Mombasa and Nairobi opened in May 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2016 the government was forced to take over three small and undercapitalized banks when underlying weaknesses were exposed. The government also enacted legislation that limits interest rates banks can charge on loans and set a rate that banks must pay their depositors. This measure led to a sharp shrinkage of credit in the economy. A prolonged election cycle in 2017 hurt the economy, drained government resources, and slowed GDP growth. Drought-like conditions in parts of the country pushed 2017 inflation above 8%, but the rate had fallen to 4.5% in February 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economy, however, is well placed to resume its decade-long 5%-6% growth rate. While fiscal deficits continue to pose risks in the medium term, other economic indicators, including foreign exchange reserves, interest rates, current account deficits, remittances and FDI are positive. The credit and drought-related impediments were temporary. Now In his second term, President KENYATTA has pledged to make economic growth and development a centerpiece of his second administration, focusing on his &quot;Big Four&quot; initiatives of universal healthcare, food security, affordable housing, and expansion of manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;",$163.7 billion,$79.22 billion (2017 est.),4.90%,"$3,500 ",10.4% of GDP,79.5% (2017 est.),14.3% (2017 est.),18.9% (2017 est.),-1% (2017 est.),13.9% (2017 est.),-25.5% (2017 est.),34.5% (2017 est.),17.8% (2017 est.),47.5% (2017 est.),"tea, coffee, corn, wheat, sugarcane, fruit, vegetables;

More than 40% of Kenyans are under the age of 15 because of sustained high fertility, early marriage and childbearing, and an unmet need for family planning. Kenyaâ€™s persistent rapid population growth strains the labor market, social services, arable land, and natural resources. Although Kenya in 1967 was the first sub-Saharan country to launch a nationwide family planning program, progress in reducing the birth rate has largely stalled since the late 1990s, when the government decreased its support for family planning to focus on the HIV epidemic. Government commitment and international technical support spurred Kenyan contraceptive use, decreasing the fertility rate (children per woman) from about 8 in the late 1970s to less than 5 children twenty years later, but it has plateaued at just over 3 children today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenya is a source of emigrants and a host country for refugees. In the 1960s and 1970s, Kenyans pursued higher education in the UK because of colonial ties, but as British immigration rules tightened, the US, the then Soviet Union, and Canada became attractive study destinations. Kenyaâ€™s stagnant economy and political problems during the 1980s and 1990s led to an outpouring of Kenyan students and professionals seeking permanent opportunities in the West and southern Africa. Nevertheless, Kenyaâ€™s relative stability since its independence in 1963 has attracted hundreds of thousands of refugees escaping violent conflicts in neighboring countries; Kenya shelters more than 300,000 Somali refugees as of April 2017.&lt;/p&gt;","3,819 km (2018)",485 km 1.435-m gauge (2018),"3,334 km 1.000-m gauge (2018)",,,"&lt;strong&gt;aim(s):&lt;/strong&gt; establish Islamic rule in Kenya&amp;rsquo;s northeastern border region and coast; avenge Kenya&#39;s past intervention in Somalia against al-Shabaab and its ongoing participation in the African Union mission; compel Kenya to withdraw troops from Somalia; attract Kenyan recruits to support operations in Somalia&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;area(s) of operation:&lt;/strong&gt; maintains an operational and recruitment presence, mostly along the coast and the northeastern border region (2018)",,,,,,,"18,500 (2018); note - the stateless population consists of Nubians, Kenyan Somalis, and coastal Arabs; the Nubians are descendants of Sudanese soldiers recruited by the British to fight for them in East Africa more than a century ago; Nubians did not receive Kenyan citizenship when the country became independent in 1963; only recently have Nubians become a formally recognized tribe and had less trouble obtaining national IDs; Galjeel and other Somalis who have lived in Kenya for decades are included with more recent Somali refugees and denied ID cards",schistosomiasis (2016),rabies (2016),,,Mombasa,,,,,,,,New York,,,,,,"The International Maritime Bureau reports that shipping in territorial and offshore waters in the Indian Ocean remain at risk for piracy and armed robbery against ships, especially as Somali-based pirates extend their activities south; numerous commercial vessels have been attacked and hijacked both at anchor and while underway; crews have been robbed and stores or cargoes stolen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
KGZ,Kyrgyzstan,KG,29-Dec-19,"A Central Asian country of incredible natural beauty and proud nomadic traditions, most of the territory of the present-day Kyrgyz Republic was formally annexed to the Russian Empire in 1876. The Kyrgyz staged a major revolt against the Tsarist Empire in 1916 in which almost one-sixth of the Kyrgyz population was killed. The Kyrgyz Republic became a Soviet republic in 1936 and achieved independence in 1991 when the USSR dissolved. Nationwide demonstrations in 2005 and 2010 resulted in the ouster of the country&amp;rsquo;s first two presidents, Askar AKAEV and Kurmanbek BAKIEV. Interim President Roza OTUNBAEVA led a transitional government and following a nation-wide election, President Almazbek ATAMBAEV was sworn in as president in 2011. In 2017, ATAMBAEV became the first Kyrgyzstani president to step down after serving one full six-year term as required in the country&amp;rsquo;s constitution. Former prime minister and ruling Social-Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan member Sooronbay JEENBEKOV replaced him after winning an October 2017 presidential election that was the most competitive in the country&amp;rsquo;s history, although international and local election observers noted cases of vote buying and abuse of public resources. The president holds substantial powers as head of state even though the prime minister oversees the Kyrgyzstani Government and selects most cabinet members.

Cotton, wool, and meat are the main agricultural products, although only cotton is exported in any quantity. Other exports include gold, mercury, uranium, natural gas, and - in some years - electricity. The country has sought to attract foreign investment to expand its export base, including construction of hydroelectric dams, but a difficult investment climate and an ongoing legal battle with a Canadian firm over the joint ownership structure of the nationâ€™s largest gold mine deter potential investors. Remittances from Kyrgyz migrant workers, predominantly in Russia and Kazakhstan, are equivalent to more than one-quarter of Kyrgyzstanâ€™s GDP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following independence, Kyrgyzstan rapidly implemented market reforms, such as improving the regulatory system and instituting land reform. In 1998, Kyrgyzstan was the first Commonwealth of Independent States country to be accepted into the World Trade Organization. The government has privatized much of its ownership shares in public enterprises. Despite these reforms, the country suffered a severe drop in production in the early 1990s and has again faced slow growth in recent years as the global financial crisis and declining oil prices have dampened economies across Central Asia. The Kyrgyz government remains dependent on foreign donor support to finance its annual budget deficit of approximately 3 to 5% of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kyrgyz leaders hope the countryâ€™s August 2015 accession to the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) will bolster trade and investment, but slowing economies in Russia and China and low commodity prices continue to hamper economic growth. Large-scale trade and investment pledged by Kyrgyz leaders has been slow to develop. Many Kyrgyz entrepreneurs and politicians complain that non-tariff measures imposed by other EAEU member states are hurting certain sectors of the Kyrgyz economy, such as meat and dairy production, in which they have comparative advantage. Since acceding to the EAEU, the Kyrgyz Republic has continued harmonizing its laws and regulations to meet EAEU standards, though many local entrepreneurs believe this process as disjointed and incomplete. Kyrgyzstanâ€™s economic development continues to be hampered by corruption, lack of administrative transparency, lack of diversity in domestic industries, and difficulty attracting foreign aid and investment.&lt;/p&gt;",$23.15 billion,$7.565 billion (2017 est.),4.60%,"$3,700 ",27.3% of GDP,85.4% (2017 est.),18.9% (2017 est.),33.2% (2017 est.),1.8% (2017 est.),39.7% (2017 est.),-79% (2017 est.),14.6% (2017 est.),31.2% (2017 est.),54.2% (2017 est.),"cotton, potatoes, vegetables, grapes, fruits and berries;

KNA,"Korea, North",KN,29-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;An independent kingdom for much of its long history, Korea was occupied by Japan beginning in 1905 following the Russo-Japanese War. Five years later, Japan formally annexed the entire peninsula. Following World War II, Korea was split with the northern half coming under Soviet-sponsored communist control. After failing in the Korean War (1950-53) to conquer the US-backed Republic of Korea (ROK) in the southern portion by force, North Korea (DPRK), under its founder President KIM Il Sung, adopted a policy of ostensible diplomatic and economic &quot;self-reliance&quot; as a check against outside influence. The DPRK demonized the US as the ultimate threat to its social system through state-funded propaganda, and molded political, economic, and military policies around the core ideological objective of eventual unification of Korea under Pyongyang&#39;s control. KIM Il Sung&#39;s son, KIM Jong Il, was officially designated as his father&#39;s successor in 1980, assuming a growing political and managerial role until the elder KIM&#39;s death in 1994. Under KIM Jong Il&#39;s rein, the DPRK continued developing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. KIM Jong Un was publicly unveiled as his father&#39;s successor in 2010. Following KIM Jong Il&#39;s death in 2011, KIM Jong Un quickly assumed power and has since occupied the regime&#39;s highest political and military posts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After decades of economic mismanagement and resource misallocation, the DPRK since the mid-1990s has faced chronic food shortages. In recent years, the North&#39;s domestic agricultural production has increased, but still falls far short of producing sufficient food to provide for its entire population. The DPRK began to ease restrictions to allow semi-private markets, starting in 2002, but has made few other efforts to meet its goal of improving the overall standard of living. North Korea&#39;s history of regional military provocations; proliferation of military-related items; long-range missile development; WMD programs including tests of nuclear devices in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016, and 2017; and massive conventional armed forces are of major concern to the international community and have limited the DPRK&#39;s international engagement, particularly economically. In 2013, the DPRK declared a&amp;nbsp;policy of simultaneous development of its nuclear weapons program and economy. In late 2017, KIM Jong Un declared the North&#39;s nuclear weapons development complete. In 2018, KIM announced a pivot towards diplomacy, including a re-prioritization of economic development, a pause in missile testing beginning in late 2017, and a refrain from anti-US rhetoric starting in June 2018. Since 2018, KIM has participated in four meetings with Chinese President XI Jinping, three with ROK President MOON Jae-in, and three with US President TRUMP. Since July 2019, North Korea has restarted its short-range missile tests and issued statements condemning the US.&lt;/p&gt;","Eastern Asia, northern half of the Korean Peninsula bordering the Korea Bay and the Sea of Japan, between China and South Korea","40 00 N, 127 00 E",Asia,"120,538 sq km","120,408 sq km",130 sq km,slightly larger than Virginia;

Industrial capital stock is nearly beyond repair as a result of years of underinvestment, shortages of spare parts, and poor maintenance. Large-scale military spending and development of its ballistic missile and nuclear program severely draws off resources needed for investment and civilian consumption. Industrial and power outputs have stagnated for years at a fraction of pre-1990 levels. Frequent weather-related crop failures aggravated chronic food shortages caused by on-going systemic problems, including a lack of arable land, collective farming practices, poor soil quality, insufficient fertilization, and persistent shortages of tractors and fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mid 1990s through mid-2000s were marked by severe famine and widespread starvation. Significant food aid was provided by the international community through 2009. Since that time, food assistance has declined significantly. In the last few years, domestic corn and rice production has improved, although domestic production does not fully satisfy demand. A large portion of the population continues to suffer from prolonged malnutrition and poor living conditions. Since 2002, the government has allowed semi-private markets to begin selling a wider range of goods, allowing North Koreans to partially make up for diminished public distribution system rations. It also implemented changes in the management process of communal farms in an effort to boost agricultural output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2009, North Korea carried out a redenomination of its currency, capping the amount of North Korean won that could be exchanged for the new notes, and limiting the exchange to a one-week window. A concurrent crackdown on markets and foreign currency use yielded severe shortages and inflation, forcing Pyongyang to ease the restrictions by February 2010. In response to the sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan and the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island in 2010, South Koreaâ€™s government cut off most aid, trade, and bilateral cooperation activities. In February 2016, South Korea ceased its remaining bilateral economic activity by closing the Kaesong Industrial Complex in response to North Koreaâ€™s fourth nuclear test a month earlier. This nuclear test and another in September 2016 resulted in two United Nations Security Council Resolutions that targeted North Koreaâ€™s foreign currency earnings, particularly coal and other mineral exports. Throughout 2017, North Koreaâ€™s continued nuclear and missile tests led to a tightening of UN sanctions, resulting in full sectoral bans on DPRK exports and drastically limited key imports. Over the last decade, China has been North Koreaâ€™s primary trading partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The North Korean Government continues to stress its goal of improving the overall standard of living, but has taken few steps to make that goal a reality for its populace. In 2016, the regime used two mass mobilizations â€” one totaling 70 days and another 200 days â€” to spur the population to increase production and complete construction projects quickly. The regime released a five-year economic development strategy in May 2016 that outlined plans for promoting growth across sectors. Firm political control remains the governmentâ€™s overriding concern, which likely will inhibit formal changes to North Koreaâ€™s current economic system.&lt;/p&gt;",$40 billion,$28 billion (2013 est.)

Earnings from fishing licenses and seafarer remittances are important sources of income. Although the number of seafarers employed declined due to changes in global shipping demands, remittances are expected to improve with more overseas temporary and seasonal work opportunities for Kiribati nationals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economic development is constrained by a shortage of skilled workers, weak infrastructure, and remoteness from international markets. The public sector dominates economic activity, with ongoing capital projects in infrastructure including road rehabilitation, water and sanitation projects, and renovations to the international airport, spurring some growth. Public debt increased from 23% of GDP at the end of 2015 to 25.8% in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiribati is dependent on foreign aid, which was estimated to have contributed over 32.7% in 2016 to the governmentâ€™s finances. The countryâ€™s sovereign fund, the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF), which is held offshore, had an estimated balance of $855.5 million in late July 2016. The RERF seeks to avoid exchange rate risk by holding investments in more than 20 currencies, including the Australian dollar, US dollar, the Japanese yen, and the Euro. Drawdowns from the RERF helped finance the governmentâ€™s annual budget.&lt;/p&gt;",$227 million,$197 million (2017 est.),3.10%,"$2,000 ",,,,,,,,23% (2016 est.),7% (2016 est.),70% (2016 est.),"copra, breadfruit, fish","fishing, handicrafts",1.1% (2012 est.),"39,000 (2010 est.)",15%,10%,75% (2010),30.60%, NA, NA, NA,151.2 million (2017 est.),277.5 million (2017 est.),76.8% (of GDP) (2017 est.),-64.1% (of GDP) (2017 est.),26.3% of GDP,NA,0.40%,,,,,,&lt;p&gt;NA&lt;/p&gt;,$18 million,$84.75 million,"Philippines 50.8%, Malaysia 17.2%, US 11.4%, Bangladesh 5.8%, Fiji 5.4% (2017)","fish, coconut products",$107.1 million,"food, machinery and equipment, miscellaneous manufactured goods, fuel","Australia 29.3%, Fiji 17.3%, NZ 10.7%, China 5.8%, US 5.8%, Singapore 5.1%, Japan 4.6%, Thailand 4.1% (2017)",$8.37 million,$40.9 million,&lt;p&gt;NA&lt;/p&gt;,,Australian dollars (AUD) per US dollar -,,29 million kWh (2016 est.),26.97 million kWh (2016 est.),0 kWh (2016 est.),0 kWh (2016 est.),"11,000 kW (2016 est.)",73% of total installed capacity (2016 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),27% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),0 bbl/day (2018 est.),0 bbl/day (2015 est.),0 bbl/day (2015 est.),0 bbl (1 January 2018 est.),0 bbl/day (2015 est.),400 bbl/day (2016 est.),0 bbl/day (2015 est.),420 bbl/day (2015 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (1 January 2014 est.),"58,850 Mt (2017 est.)",765,1 (2017 est.),"46,123",43 (2017 est.),generally good quality national and international service; wireline service available on Tarawa and Kiritimati (Christmas Island); connections to outer islands by HF/VHF radiotelephone; recently formed&amp;nbsp;mobile network operator (MNO)&amp;nbsp;is implementing the first phase of improvements with 3G and 4G upgrades on some islands; islands are connected to each other and the rest of the world via satellite,fixed-line 1 per 100 and mobile-cellular 43 per 100 subscriptions,"country code - 686; landing point for the Southern Cross NEXT submarine cable system from Australia, 7 Pacific Ocean island countries to the US; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Pacific Ocean) (2019)","multi-channel TV packages provide access to Australian and US stations; 1 government-operated radio station broadcasts on AM, FM, and shortwave (2017)",.ki,"14,649",13.7% (July 2016 est.),76, less than 1 (2017 est.),,no regular military forces (establishment prevented by the constitution); Police Force (2011),,,,,,T3 (2016),19 (2013),4 (2017),,,4 (2017),,,15 (2013),,,,10 (2013),5 (2013),,,,,111,"bulk carrier 3, general cargo 46, oil tanker 16, other 46 (2018)",,,,&lt;p&gt;none&lt;/p&gt;,,23.1 years (2009 est.),22.3% (2009),,,,14.9% (2009),,,,,84.9% (2016),88.4% (2016),82.2% (2016),Kiribati does not have military forces; defense assistance is provided by Australia and NZ,,5 km (small network of canals in Line Islands) (2012),"Betio (Tarawa Atoll), Canton Island, English Harbor",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,670 km (2017),,,,,,,,,,0 km,,,,"none; the Kiribati Permanent Mission to the UN serves as the embassy; it is headed by Teburoro TITO (since 13 September 2017); address: 800 Second Avenue, Suite 400A, New York, NY 10017; telephone: [1](212)867-3310; FAX: [1](212)867-3320",the US does not have an embassy in Kiribati; the US Ambassador to Fiji is accredited to Kiribati,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
KAZ,Kazakhstan,KZ,19-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;Ethnic Kazakhs, a mix of Turkic and Mongol nomadic tribes with additional Persian cultural influences, migrated to the region in the 15th century. The area was conquered by Russia in the 18th and 19th centuries, and Kazakhstan became a Soviet Republic in 1925. Repression and starvation associated with forced agricultural collectivization led to a massive number of deaths in the 1930s. During the 1950s and 1960s, the agricultural &quot;Virgin Lands&quot; program led to an influx of settlers (mostly ethnic Russians, but also other nationalities) and at the time of Kazakhstan&amp;rsquo;s independence in 1991, ethnic Kazakhs were a minority. Non-Muslim ethnic minorities departed Kazakhstan in large numbers from the mid-1990s through the mid-2000s and a national program has repatriated about a million ethnic Kazakhs (from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Mongolia, and the Xinjiang region of China) back to Kazakhstan. As a result of this shift, the ethnic Kazakh share of the population now exceeds two-thirds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kazakhstan&#39;s economy is the largest in the Central Asian states, mainly due to the country&#39;s vast natural resources.

Geographically the largest of the former Soviet republics, excluding Russia, Kazakhstan, g possesses substantial fossil fuel reserves and other minerals and metals, such as uranium, copper, and zinc. It also has a large agricultural sector featuring livestock and grain. The government realizes that its economy suffers from an overreliance on oil and extractive industries and has made initial attempts to diversify its economy by targeting sectors like transport, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications, petrochemicals and food processing for greater development and investment. It also adopted a Subsoil Code in December 2017 with the aim of increasing exploration and investment in the hydrocarbon, and particularly mining, sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazakhstan&#39;s oil production and potential is expanding rapidly. A $36.8 billion expansion of Kazakhstanâ€™s premiere Tengiz oil field by Chevron-led Tengizchevroil should be complete in 2022. Meanwhile, the super-giant Kashagan field finally launched production in October 2016 after years of delay and an estimated $55 billion in development costs. Kazakhstanâ€™s total oil production in 2017 climbed 10.5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazakhstan is landlocked and depends on Russia to export its oil to Europe. It also exports oil directly to China. In 2010, Kazakhstan joined Russia and Belarus to establish a Customs Union in an effort to boost foreign investment and improve trade. The Customs Union evolved into a Single Economic Space in 2012 and the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) in January 2015. Supported by rising commodity prices, Kazakhstanâ€™s exports to EAEU countries increased 30.2% in 2017. Imports from EAEU countries grew by 24.1%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economic downturn of its EAEU partner, Russia, and the decline in global commodity prices from 2014 to 2016 contributed to an economic slowdown in Kazakhstan. In 2014, Kazakhstan devalued its currency, the tenge, and announced a stimulus package to cope with its economic challenges. In the face of further decline in the ruble, oil prices, and the regional economy, Kazakhstan announced in 2015 it would replace its currency band with a floating exchange rate, leading to a sharp fall in the value of the tenge. Since reaching a low of 391 to the dollar in January 2016, the tenge has modestly appreciated, helped by somewhat higher oil prices.

LAO,Laos,LA,29-Dec-19,"Modern-day Laos has its roots in the ancient Lao kingdom of Lan Xang, established in the 14th century under King FA NGUM. For 300 years Lan Xang had influence reaching into present-day Cambodia and Thailand, as well as over all of what is now Laos. After centuries of gradual decline, Laos came under the domination of Siam (Thailand) from the late 18th century until the late 19th century, when it became part of French Indochina. The Franco-Siamese Treaty of 1907 defined the current Lao border with Thailand. In 1975, the communist Pathet Lao took control of the government, ending a six-century-old monarchy and instituting a strict socialist regime closely aligned to Vietnam. A gradual, limited return to private enterprise and the liberalization of foreign investment laws began in 1988. Laos became a member of ASEAN in 1997 and the WTO in 2013.","Southeastern Asia, northeast of Thailand, west of Vietnam","18 00 N, 105 00 E",Southeast Asia,"236,800 sq km","230,800 sq km","6,000 sq km",about twice the size of Pennsylvania;

LIE,Liberia,LI,9-Dec-19,"Settlement of freed slaves from the US in what is today Liberia began in 1822; by 1847, the Americo-Liberians were able to establish a republic. William TUBMAN, president from 1944-71, did much to promote foreign investment and to bridge the economic, social, and political gaps between the descendants of the original settlers and the inhabitants of the interior. In 1980, a military coup led by Samuel DOE ushered in a decade of authoritarian rule. In December 1989, Charles TAYLOR launched a rebellion against DOE&#39;s regime that led to a prolonged civil war in which DOE was killed. A period of relative peace in 1997 allowed for an election that brought TAYLOR to power, but major fighting resumed in 2000. An August 2003 peace agreement ended the war and prompted the resignation of former president Charles TAYLOR, who was convicted by the UN-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone in The Hague for his involvement in Sierra Leone&#39;s civil war. After two years of rule by a transitional government, democratic elections in late 2005 brought President Ellen JOHNSON SIRLEAF to power. She subsequently won reelection in 2011 but was challenged to rebuild Liberia&#39;s economy, particularly following the 2014-15 Ebola epidemic, and to reconcile a nation still recovering from 14 years of fighting. Constitutional term limits barred President JOHNSON SIRLEAF from running for re-election. Legal challenges delayed the 2017 presidential runoff election, which was eventually won by George WEAH. In March 2018, the UN completed its 15-year peacekeeping mission in Liberia.","Western Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between Cote d&#39;Ivoire and Sierra Leone","6 30 N, 9 30 W",Africa,"111,369 sq km","96,320 sq km","15,049 sq km",slightly larger than Virginia,"1,667 km","Guinea 590 km, Cote d&#39;Ivoire 778 km, Sierra Leone 299 km",579 km,,,,,"tropical;

It is richly endowed with water, mineral resources, forests, and a climate favorable to agriculture. Its principal exports are iron ore, rubber, diamonds, and gold. Palm oil and cocoa are emerging as new export products. The government has attempted to revive raw timber extraction and is encouraging oil exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s and early 2000s, civil war and government mismanagement destroyed much of Liberia&#39;s economy, especially infrastructure in and around the capital. Much of the conflict was fueled by control over Liberiaâ€™s natural resources. With the conclusion of fighting and the installation of a democratically elected government in 2006, businesses that had fled the country began to return. The country achieved high growth during the period 2010-13 due to favorable world prices for its commodities. However, during the 2014-2015 Ebola crisis, the economy declined and many foreign-owned businesses departed with their capital and expertise. The epidemic forced the government to divert scarce resources to combat the spread of the virus, reducing funds available for needed public investment. The cost of addressing the Ebola epidemic coincided with decreased economic activity reducing government revenue, although higher donor support significantly offset this loss. During the same period, global commodities prices for key exports fell and have yet to recover to pre-Ebola levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, gold was a key driver of growth, as a new mining project began its first full year of production; iron ore exports are also increased as Arcelor Mittal opened new mines at Mount Gangra. The completion of the rehabilitation of the Mount Coffee Hydroelectric Dam increased electricity production to support ongoing and future economic activity, although electricity tariffs remain high relative to other countries in the region and transmission infrastructure is limited. Presidential and legislative elections in October 2017 generated election-related spending pressures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revitalizing the economy in the future will depend on economic diversification, increasing investment and trade, higher global commodity prices, sustained foreign aid and remittances, development of infrastructure and institutions, combating corruption, and maintaining political stability and security.&lt;/p&gt;",$6.112 billion,$3.285 billion (2017 est.),2.50%,"$1,300 ", NA%,128.8% (2016 est.),16.7% (2016 est.),19.5% (2016 est.),6.7% (2016 est.),17.5% (2016 est.),-89.2% (2016 est.),34% (2017 est.),13.8% (2017 est.),52.2% (2017 est.),"rubber, coffee, cocoa, rice, cassava (manioc, tapioca), palm oil, sugarcane, bananas;

Female mortality is also increased by the prevalence of female genital cutting (FGC), which is practiced by 10 of Liberiaâ€™s 16 tribes and affects more than two-thirds of women and girls. FGC is an initiation ritual performed in rural bush schools, which teach traditional beliefs on marriage and motherhood and are an obstacle to formal classroom education for Liberian girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liberia has been both a source and a destination for refugees.

Occupied by both French and Russian troops during the Napoleonic Wars, it became a sovereign state in 1806 and joined the German Confederation in 1815. Liechtenstein became fully independent in 1866 when the Confederation dissolved. Until the end of World War I, it was closely tied to Austria, but the economic devastation caused by that conflict forced Liechtenstein to enter into a customs and monetary union with Switzerland. Since World War II (in which Liechtenstein remained neutral), the country&#39;s low taxes have spurred outstanding economic growth. In 2000, shortcomings in banking regulatory oversight resulted in concerns about the use of financial institutions for money laundering.

The Liechtenstein economy is widely diversified with a large number of small and medium-sized businesses, particularly in the services sector. Low business taxes - a flat tax of 12.5% on income is applied - and easy incorporation rules have induced many holding companies to establish nominal offices in Liechtenstein, providing 30% of state revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country participates in a customs union with Switzerland and uses the Swiss franc as its national currency. It imports more than 90% of its energy requirements.

The government is working to harmonize its economic policies with those of an integrated EU.

In December 2008, Liechtenstein signed a Tax Information Exchange Agreement with the US. Upon Liechtenstein&#39;s conclusion of 12 bilateral information-sharing agreements, the OECD in October 2009 removed the principality from its &quot;grey list&quot; of countries that had yet to implement the organization&#39;s Model Tax Convention. By the end of 2010, Liechtenstein had signed 25 Tax Information Exchange Agreements or Double Tax Agreements. In 2011, Liechtenstein joined the Schengen area, which allows passport-free travel across 26 European countries.

LTU,Lesotho,LT,5-Dec-19,"Basutoland was renamed the Kingdom of Lesotho upon independence from the UK in 1966. The Basotho National Party ruled the country during its first two decades. King MOSHOESHOE II was exiled in 1990, but returned to Lesotho in 1992 and was reinstated in 1995 and subsequently succeeded by his son, King LETSIE III, in 1996. Constitutional government was restored in 1993 after seven years of military rule. In 1998, violent protests and a military mutiny following a contentious election prompted a brief but bloody intervention by South African and Botswana military forces under the aegis of the Southern African Development Community. Subsequent constitutional reforms restored relative political stability. Peaceful parliamentary elections were held in 2002, but the National Assembly elections in 2007 were hotly contested and aggrieved parties disputed how the electoral law was applied to award proportional seats in the Assembly. In 2012, competitive elections involving 18 parties saw Prime Minister Motsoahae Thomas THABANE form a coalition government - the first in the country&#39;s history - that ousted the 14-year incumbent, Pakalitha MOSISILI, who peacefully transferred power the following month. MOSISILI returned to power in snap elections in February 2015 after the collapse of THABANE&amp;rsquo;s coalition government and an alleged attempted military coup. In June 2017, THABANE returned to become prime minister.","Southern Africa, an enclave of South Africa","29 30 S, 28 30 E",Africa,"30,355 sq km","30,355 sq km",0 sq km,slightly smaller than Maryland,"1,106 km",South Africa 1106 km,0 km (landlocked),,,,,"temperate;

About three-fourths of the people live in rural areas and engage in animal herding and subsistence agriculture, although Lesotho produces less than 20% of the nation&#39;s demand for food. Agriculture is vulnerable to weather and climate variability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lesotho relies on South Africa for much of its economic activity; Lesotho imports 85% of the goods it consumes from South Africa, including most agricultural inputs. Households depend heavily on remittances from family members working in South Africa in mines, on farms, and as domestic workers, though mining employment has declined substantially since the 1990s. Lesotho is a member of the Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU), and revenues from SACU accounted for roughly 26% of total GDP in 2016; however, SACU revenues are volatile and expected to decline over the next 5 years. Lesotho also gains royalties from the South African Government for water transferred to South Africa from a dam and reservoir system in Lesotho. However, the government continues to strengthen its tax system to reduce dependency on customs duties and other transfers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government maintains a large presence in the economy - government consumption accounted for about 26% of GDP in 2017. The government remains Lesotho&#39;s largest employer; in 2016, the government wage bill rose to 23% of GDP â€“ the largest in sub-Saharan Africa.

More than half of its population lives below the property line, and the countryâ€™s HIV/AIDS prevalence rate is the second highest in the world. In addition, Lesotho is a small, mountainous, landlocked country with little arable land, leaving its population vulnerable to food shortages and reliant on remittances. Lesothoâ€™s persistently high infant, child, and maternal mortality rates have been increasing during the last decade, according to the last two Demographic and Health Surveys. Despite these significant shortcomings, Lesotho has made good progress in education; it is on-track to achieve universal primary education and has one of the highest adult literacy rates in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lesothoâ€™s migration history is linked to its unique geography; it is surrounded by South Africa with which it shares linguistic and cultural traits. Lesotho at one time had more of its workforce employed outside its borders than any other country. Today remittances equal about 17% of its GDP. With few job options at home, a high rate of poverty, and higher wages available across the border, labor migration to South Africa replaced agriculture as the prevailing Basotho source of income decades ago. The majority of Basotho migrants were single men contracted to work as gold miners in South Africa. However, migration trends changed in the 1990s, and fewer men found mining jobs in South Africa because of declining gold prices, stricter immigration policies, and a preference for South African workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although men still dominate cross-border labor migration, more women are working in South Africa, mostly as domestics, because they are widows or their husbands are unemployed. Internal rural-urban flows have also become more frequent, with more women migrating within the country to take up jobs in the garment industry or moving to care for loved ones with HIV/AIDS.

Luxembourg, the only Grand Duchy in the world, is a landlocked country in northwestern Europe surrounded by Belgium, France, and Germany. Despite its small landmass and small population, Luxembourg is the fifth-wealthiest country in the world when measured on a gross domestic product (PPP) per capita basis. Luxembourg has one of the highest current account surpluses as a share of GDP in the euro zone, and it maintains a healthy budgetary position, with a 2017 surplus of 0.5% of GDP, and the lowest public debt level in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2002, Luxembourgâ€™s government has proactively implemented policies and programs to support economic diversification and to attract foreign direct investment. The government focused on key innovative industries that showed promise for supporting economic growth: logistics, information and communications technology (ICT); health technologies, including biotechnology and biomedical research; clean energy technologies, and more recently, space technology and financial services technologies. The economy has evolved and flourished, posting strong GDP growth of 3.4% in 2017, far outpacing the European average of 1.8%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luxembourg remains a financial powerhouse â€“ the financial sector accounts for more than 35% of GDP - because of the exponential growth of the investment fund sector through the launch and development of cross-border funds (UCITS) in the 1990s. Luxembourg is the worldâ€™s second-largest investment fund asset domicile, after the US, with $4 trillion of assets in custody in financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luxembourg has lost some of its advantage as a favorable tax location because of OECD and EU pressure, as well as the &quot;LuxLeaks&quot; scandal, which revealed advantageous tax treatments offered to foreign corporations. In 2015, the governmentâ€™s compliance with EU requirements to implement automatic exchange of tax information on savings accounts - thus ending banking secrecy - has constricted banking activity. Likewise, changes to the way EU members collect taxes from e-commerce has cut Luxembourgâ€™s sales tax revenues, requiring the government to raise additional levies and to reduce some direct social benefits as part of the tax reform package of 2017. The tax reform package also included reductions in the corporate tax rate and increases in deductions for families, both intended to increase purchasing power and increase competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;",$62.11 billion,$62.53 billion (2017 est.),2.30%,"$105,100 ",22.3% of GDP,30.2% (2017 est.),16.5% (2017 est.),16.2% (2017 est.),1.1% (2017 est.),230% (2017 est.),-194% (2017 est.),0.3% (2017 est.),12.8% (2017 est.),86.9% (2017 est.),"grapes, barley, oats, potatoes, wheat, fruits; dairy and livestock products","banking and financial services, construction, real estate services, iron, metals, and steel, information technology, telecommunications, cargo transportation and logistics, chemicals, engineering, tires, glass, aluminum, tourism, biotechnology",1.9% (2017 est.),"282,800 (2017 est.)",1.10%,20%,78.9% (2013 est.),5.80%, NA,3.50%,23.8% (2000),27.75 billion (2017 est.),26.8 billion (2017 est.),44.4% (of GDP) (2017 est.),1.5% (of GDP) (2017 est.),23% of GDP,calendar year,2.10%,0%,1.98%,$229.2 billion,$229.2 billion,$109.9 billion,$78.64 billion,$3.112 billion,$15.99 billion,"Germany 25.6%, Belgium 17.6%, France 14%, Netherlands 5.1%, Italy 4.1%, UK 4.1% (2017)","machinery and equipment, steel products, chemicals, rubber products, glass",$20.66 billion,"commercial aircraft, minerals, chemicals, metals, foodstuffs, luxury consumer goods","Belgium 32%, Germany 24.9%, France 11.1%, US 5.7%, Netherlands 4.9% (2017)",$974 million,$3.806 trillion,$11.21 billion,&lt;p&gt;NA&lt;/p&gt;,euros (EUR) per US dollar -,100% (2016),334.5 million kWh (2016 est.),6.475 billion kWh (2016 est.),1.42 billion kWh (2016 est.),7.718 billion kWh (2016 est.),1.709 million kW (2016 est.),25% of total installed capacity (2016 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),8% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),67% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),0 bbl/day (2018 est.),0 bbl/day (2017 est.),0 bbl/day (2017 est.),0 bbl (1 January 2018 est.),0 bbl/day (2017 est.),"59,850 bbl/day (2017 est.)",0 bbl/day (2017 est.),"59,020 bbl/day (2017 est.)",0 cu m (2017 est.),792.8 million cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),792.8 million cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (1 January 2014 est.),10.72 million Mt (2017 est.),"275,300",46 (2017 est.),"794,000",134 (2017 est.),"highly developed, completely automated and efficient system; by 2020 the government&amp;rsquo;s program is to provide a 1Gb/s service to all citizens, and to make Luxembourg the first fully fibred country in Europe; new law requiring&amp;nbsp; SIM cards be registered has slowed down growth for mobile subscribers; 5G launch by 2020 (2018)",fixed-line teledensity about&amp;nbsp;46 per 100 persons; nationwide mobile-cellular telephone system with market for mobile-cellular phones virtually saturated with 134 per 100 mobile-cellular (2018),country code - 352,"Luxembourg has a long tradition of operating radio and TV services for pan-European audiences and is home to Europe&#39;s largest privately owned broadcast media group, the RTL Group, which operates 46 TV stations and 29 radio stations in Europe; also home to Europe&#39;s largest satellite operator, Societe Europeenne des Satellites (SES); domestically, the RTL Group operates TV and radio networks; other domestic private radio and TV operators and French and German stations available; satellite and cable TV services available",.lu,"567,698",97.5% (July 2016 est.),"212,900",36 (2017 est.),0.56% of GDP,Luxembourg Army (l&#39;Arm&amp;eacute;e Luxembourgeoise) (2019),18-26 years of age for male and female voluntary military service; no conscription; Luxembourg citizen or EU citizen with 3-year residence in Luxembourg (2019),3 (2015),119 (2015),"1,830,972 (2015)","6,309,473,324 mt-km (2015)",LX (2016),2 (2013),1 (2017),1 (2017),,,,,1 (2013),,,,,1 (2013),1 (2013),"142 km gas, 27 km refined products (2013)",,,152,"bulk carrier 4, container ship 9, general cargo 6, oil tanker 2, other 131 (2018)",,,,&lt;p&gt;none&lt;/p&gt;,,30.1 years (2015 est.),,,,,,"+1hr, begins last Sunday in March; ends last Sunday in October",30.4,,,,,,,,37 km (on Moselle River) (2010),Mertert (Moselle),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,275 km (2014),275 km 1.435-m gauge (275 km electrified) (2014),,,,,83 (2018),,,"2,875 km (2019)",none (landlocked),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LBY,Libya,LY,23-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;The Italians supplanted the Ottoman Turks in the area around Tripoli in 1911 and did not relinquish their hold until 1943 when they were defeated in World War II. Libya then passed to UN administration and achieved independence in 1951. Following a 1969 military coup, Col. Muammar al-QADHAFI assumed leadership and began to espouse his political system at home, which was a combination of socialism and Islam. During the 1970s, QADHAFI used oil revenues to promote his ideology outside Libya, supporting subversive and terrorist activities that included the downing of two airliners - one over Scotland, another in Northern Africa - and a discotheque bombing in Berlin. UN sanctions in 1992 isolated QADHAFI politically and economically following the attacks; sanctions were lifted in 2003 following Libyan acceptance of responsibility for the bombings and agreement to claimant compensation. QADHAFI also agreed to end Libya&#39;s program to develop weapons of mass destruction, and he made significant strides in normalizing relations with Western nations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unrest that began in several Middle Eastern and North African countries in late 2010 erupted in Libyan cities in early 2011. QADHAFI&#39;s brutal crackdown on protesters spawned a civil war that triggered UN authorization of air and naval intervention by the international community. After months of seesaw fighting between government and opposition forces, the QADHAFI regime was toppled in mid-2011 and replaced by a transitional government known as the National Transitional Council (NTC). In 2012, the NTC handed power to an elected parliament, the General National Congress (GNC). Voters chose a new parliament to replace the GNC in June 2014 - the House of Representatives (HoR), which relocated to the eastern city of Tobruk after fighting broke out in Tripoli and Benghazi in July 2014.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In December 2015, the UN brokered an agreement among a broad array of Libyan political parties and social groups - known as the Libyan Political Agreement (LPA). Members of the Libyan Political Dialogue, including representatives of the HoR and GNC, signed the LPA in December 2015. The LPA called for the formation of an interim Government of National Accord or GNA, with a nine-member Presidency Council, the HoR, and an advisory High Council of State that most ex-GNC members joined. The LPA&amp;rsquo;s roadmap for a transition to a new constitution and elected government was subsequently endorsed by UN Security Council Resolution 2259, which also called upon member states to cease official contact with parallel institutions. In January 2016, the HoR voted to approve the LPA, including the Presidency Council, while voting against a controversial provision on security leadership positions and the Presidency Council&amp;rsquo;s proposed cabinet of ministers. In March 2016, the GNA Presidency Council seated itself in Tripoli. In 2016, the GNA twice announced a slate of ministers who operate in an acting capacity, but the HoR did not endorse the ministerial list. The HoR and defunct-GNC-affiliated political hardliners continued to oppose the GNA and hamper the LPA&amp;rsquo;s implementation. In September 2017, UN Special Representative Ghassan SALAME announced a new roadmap for national political reconciliation. SALAME&amp;rsquo;s plan called for amendments to the LPA, a national conference of Libyan leaders, and a constitutional referendum and general elections. In November 2018, the international partners supported SALAME&amp;rsquo;s recalibrated Action Plan for Libya that aimed to break the political deadlock by holding a National Conference in Libya in 2019 on a timeline for political transition.&amp;nbsp; The National Conference was delayed following a failure of the parties to implement an agreement mediated by SALAME in Abu Dhabi on February 27, and the subsequent military action by Khalifa HAFTAR&amp;rsquo;s Libyan National Army against GNA forces in Tripoli that began in April 2019.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;","Northern Africa, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Egypt, Tunisia, and Algeria","25 00 N, 17 00 E",Africa,"1,759,540 sq km","1,759,540 sq km",0 sq km,about 2.5 times the size of Texas;

The Libyan dinar has lost much of its value since 2014 and the resulting gap between official and black market exchange rates has spurred the growth of a shadow economy and contributed to inflation. The country suffers from widespread power outages, caused by shortages of fuel for power generation. Living conditions, including access to clean drinking water, medical services, and safe housing have all declined since 2011. Oil production in 2017 reached a five-year high, driving GDP growth, with daily average production rising to 879,000 barrels per day.

It is also a hub for transit migration to Europe because of its proximity to southern Europe and its lax border controls. Labor migrants have been drawn to Libya since the development of its oil sector in the 1960s. Until the latter part of the 1990s, most migrants to Libya were Arab (primarily Egyptians and Sudanese). However, international isolation stemming from Libyaâ€™s involvement in international terrorism and a perceived lack of support from Arab countries led QADHAFI in 1998 to adopt a decade-long pan-African policy that enabled large numbers of sub-Saharan migrants to enter Libya without visas to work in the construction and agricultural industries. Although sub-Saharan Africans provided a cheap labor source, they were poorly treated and were subjected to periodic mass expulsions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the mid-2000s, domestic animosity toward African migrants and a desire to reintegrate into the international community motivated QADHAFI to impose entry visas on Arab and African immigrants and to agree to joint maritime patrols and migrant repatriations with Italy, the main recipient of illegal migrants departing Libya. As his regime neared collapse in 2011, QADHAFI reversed his policy of cooperating with Italy to curb illegal migration and sent boats loaded with migrants and asylum seekers to strain European resources. Libyaâ€™s 2011 revolution decreased immigration drastically and prompted nearly 800,000 migrants to flee to third countries, mainly Tunisia and Egypt, or to their countries of origin. The inflow of migrants declined in 2012 but returned to normal levels by 2013, despite continued hostility toward sub-Saharan Africans and a less-inviting job market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Libya is not an appealing destination for migrants, since 2014, transiting migrants â€“ primarily from East and West Africa â€“ continue to exploit its political instability and weak border controls and use it as a primary departure area to migrate across the central Mediterranean to Europe in growing numbers. In addition, more than 200,000 people were displaced internally as of August 2017 by fighting between armed groups in eastern and western Libya and, to a lesser extent, by inter-tribal clashes in the countryâ€™s south.&lt;/p&gt;",,,,&lt;strong&gt;aim(s): &lt;/strong&gt;overthrow various African regimes and replace them with one ruled by sharia; establish a regional Islamic caliphate across all of North and West Africa&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;area(s) of operation:&lt;/strong&gt; leadership headquartered in Algeria; operates in Tunisia and Libya (2018),,"&lt;strong&gt;aim(s): &lt;/strong&gt;replace several African governments, including Libya&#39;s transitional government, with an Islamic state&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;area(s) of operation: &lt;/strong&gt;maintains an operational presence; engages in kidnappings for ransom (2018)",,"Libya is a destination and transit country for men and women from sub-Saharan Africa and Asia subjected to forced labor and forced prostitution; migrants who seek employment in Libya as laborers and domestic workers or who transit Libya en route to Europe are vulnerable to forced labor; private employers also exploit migrants from detention centers as forced laborers on farms and construction sites, returning them to detention when they are no longer needed; some sub-Saharan women are reportedly forced to work in Libyan brothels, particularly in the countryâ€™s south; since 2013, militia groups and other informal armed groups, including some affiliated with the government, are reported to conscript Libyan children under the age of 18; large-scale violence driven by militias, civil unrest, and increased lawlessness increased in 2014, making it more difficult to obtain information on human trafficking","Tier 3 - the Libyan Government does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so; in 2014, the governmentâ€™s capacity to address human trafficking was hampered by the ongoing power struggle and violence; the judicial system was not functioning, preventing any efforts to investigate, prosecute, or convict traffickers, complicit detention camp guards or government officials, or militias or armed groups that used child soldiers; the government failed to identify or provide protection to trafficking victims, including child conscripts, and continued to punish victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked; no public anti-trafficking awareness campaigns were conducted (2015)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Az Zawiyah, Ra&#39;s Lanuf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"previous 1951, 1977; in July 2017, the Constitutional Assembly completed and approved a draft of a new permanent constitution; in September 2018,&amp;nbsp;the House of Representatives passed a constitutional referendum law in a session with contested reports of the quorum needed to pass the vote, and submitted it to the High National Elections Commission in December to begin preparations for a constitutional referendum",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NA; note - government is in transition,"&lt;strong&gt;aim(s):&lt;/strong&gt; implement sharia in Libya&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;area(s) of operation:&lt;/strong&gt; in the east, mostly in Benghazi and Darnah&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;note:&lt;/strong&gt; officially disbanded in June 2017, but fighters and local elements remain; operated as a member of the Benghazi Revolutionaries Shura Council and Darnah Mujahidin Shura Council, a coalition of jihadist groups combating the Libyan House of Representatives-aligned forces (2018)","&lt;strong&gt;aim(s):&lt;/strong&gt; prevent the formation of a reunified Libyan state, secure control over the country&#39;s critical resources and, ultimately, establish an Islamic caliphate in Libya&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;area(s) of operation:&lt;/strong&gt; based in Libya since circa 2015, with its original headquarters in Sirte; no longer controls territory in Libya but does maintain a low-profile presence throughout much of the country (2018)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MAR,Madagascar,MA,18-Dec-19,"Madagascar was one of the last major habitable landmasses on earth settled by humans. While some transient visits to the island may have occurred in the centuries B.C., large-scale settlement began between A.D. 350 and 550 with settlers from present-day Indonesia. The island attracted Arab and Persian traders as early as the 7th century, and migrants from Africa arrived around A.D. 1000. Madagascar was a pirate stronghold during the late 17th and early 18th centuries, and served as a slave trading center into the 19th century. From the 16th to the late 19th century, a native Merina Kingdom dominated much of Madagascar. The island was conquered by the French in 1896 who made it a colony; independence was regained in 1960. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During 1992-93, free presidential and National Assembly elections were held ending 17 years of single-party rule. In 1997, in the second presidential race, Didier RATSIRAKA, the leader during the 1970s and 1980s, returned to the presidency. The 2001 presidential election was contested between the followers of Didier RATSIRAKA and Marc RAVALOMANANA, nearly causing secession of half of the country. In 2002, the High Constitutional Court announced RAVALOMANANA the winner. RAVALOMANANA won a second term in 2006 but, following protests in 2009, handed over power to the military, which then conferred the presidency on the mayor of Antananarivo, Andry RAJOELINA, in what amounted to a coup d&#39;etat. Following a lengthy mediation process led by the Southern African Development Community, Madagascar held UN-supported presidential and parliamentary elections in 2013. Former de facto finance minister Hery RAJAONARIMAMPIANINA won a runoff election in December 2013 and was inaugurated in January 2014. In January 2019, RAJOELINA was declared the winner of a runoff election against RAVALOMANANA; both RATSIRAKA and RAJAONARIMAMPIANINA also ran in the first round of the election, which took place in November 2018.","Southern Africa, island in the Indian Ocean, east of Mozambique","20 00 S, 47 00 E",Africa,"587,041 sq km","581,540 sq km","5,501 sq km",almost four times the size of Georgia;

The country faces challenges to improve education, healthcare, and the environment to boost long-term economic growth. Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, is a mainstay of the economy, accounting for more than one-fourth of GDP and employing roughly 80% of the population. Deforestation and erosion, aggravated by bushfires, slash-and-burn clearing techniques, and the use of firewood as the primary source of fuel, are serious concerns to the agriculture dependent economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After discarding socialist economic policies in the mid-1990s, Madagascar followed a World Bank- and IMF-led policy of privatization and liberalization until a 2009 coup dâ€™Ã©tat led many nations, including the United States, to suspend non-humanitarian aid until a democratically-elected president was inaugurated in 2014. The pre-coup strategy had placed the country on a slow and steady growth path from an extremely low starting point. Exports of apparel boomed after gaining duty-free access to the US market in 2000 under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA); however, Madagascar&#39;s failure to comply with the requirements of the AGOA led to the termination of the country&#39;s duty-free access in January 2010, a sharp fall in textile production, a loss of more than 100,000 jobs, and a GDP drop of nearly 11%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madagascar regained AGOA access in January 2015 and ensuing growth has been slow and fragile. Madagascar produces around 80% of the worldâ€™s vanilla and its reliance on this commodity for most of its foreign exchange is a significant source of vulnerability. Economic reforms have been modest and the countryâ€™s financial sector remains weak, limiting the use of monetary policy to control inflation.

The population is predominantly rural and poor; chronic malnutrition is prevalent, and large families are the norm. Many young Malagasy girls are withdrawn from school, marry early (often pressured to do so by their parents), and soon begin having children. Early childbearing, coupled with Madagascarâ€™s widespread poverty and lack of access to skilled health care providers during delivery, increases the risk of death and serious health problems for young mothers and their babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Child marriage perpetuates gender inequality and is prevalent among the poor, the uneducated, and rural households â€“ as of 2013, of Malagasy women aged 20 to 24, more than 40% were married and more than a third had given birth by the age of 18. Although the legal age for marriage is 18, parental consent is often given for earlier marriages or the law is flouted, especially in rural areas that make up nearly 65% of the country. Forms of arranged marriage whereby young girls are married to older men in exchange for oxen or money are traditional. If a union does not work out, a girl can be placed in another marriage, but the dowry paid to her family diminishes with each unsuccessful marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madagascarâ€™s population consists of 18 main ethnic groups, all of whom speak the same Malagasy language. Most Malagasy are multi-ethnic, however, reflecting the islandâ€™s diversity of settlers and historical contacts (see Background). Madagascarâ€™s legacy of hierarchical societies practicing domestic slavery (most notably the Merina Kingdom of the 16th to the 19th century) is evident today in persistent class tension, with some ethnic groups maintaining a caste system. Slave descendants are vulnerable to unequal access to education and jobs, despite Madagascarâ€™s constitutional guarantee of free compulsory primary education and its being party to several international conventions on human rights.

Macau&#39;s gaming and tourism businesses were fueled by China&#39;s decision to relax travel restrictions on Chinese citizens wishing to visit Macau. In 2016, Macau&#39;s gaming-related taxes accounted for more than 76% of total government revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macau&#39;s economy slowed dramatically in 2009 as a result of the global economic slowdown, but strong growth resumed in the 2010-13 period, largely on the back of tourism from mainland China and the gaming sectors. In 2015, this city of 646,800 hosted nearly 30.7 million visitors. Almost 67% came from mainland China. Macau&#39;s traditional manufacturing industry has slowed greatly since the termination of the Multi-Fiber Agreement in 2005. Services export â€” primarily gaming â€” increasingly has driven Macauâ€™s economic performance. Mainland Chinaâ€™s anti-corruption campaign brought Macauâ€™s gambling boom to a halt in 2014, with spending in casinos contracting 34.3% in 2015. As a result, Macau&#39;s inflation-adjusted GDP contracted 21.5% in 2015 and another 2.1% in 2016 - down from double-digit expansion rates in the period 2010-13 - but the economy recovered handsomely in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macau continues to face the challenges of managing its growing casino industry, risks from money-laundering activities, and the need to diversify the economy away from heavy dependence on gaming revenues. Macau&#39;s currency, the pataca, is closely tied to the Hong Kong dollar, which is also freely accepted in the territory.&lt;/p&gt;",$71.82 billion,$50.36 billion (2017 est.),9.10%,"$110,000 ",,24.2% (2017 est.),9.9% (2017 est.),18.5% (2017 est.),0.8% (2017 est.),79.4% (2017 est.),-32% (2017 est.),0% (2016 est.),6.3% (2017 est.),93.7% (2017 est.),"only 2% of land area is cultivated, mainly by vegetable growers; fishing, mostly for crustaceans, is important; some of the catch is exported to Hong Kong","tourism, gambling, clothing, textiles, electronics, footwear, toys",2% (2017 est.),"400,000 (2017 est.)",2.50%,9.80%,4.40%,2%, NA, NA, NA,14.71 billion (2017 est.),9.684 billion (2017 est.),29.2% (of GDP) (2017 est.),10% (of GDP) (2017 est.),0% of GDP,calendar year,1.20%,,5.25%,$7.858 billion,$7.858 billion,$17.16 billion,$2.3 billion,$16.75 billion,$1.45 billion,"Hong Kong 47.9%, China 12.6%, Japan 1% (2018)","clothing, textiles, footwear, toys, electronics, machinery and parts",$9.7 billion,"raw materials and semi-manufactured goods, consumer goods (foodstuffs, beverages, tobacco, garments and footwear, motor vehicles), capital goods, mineral fuels and oils","China 33.9%, Italy 9.3%, Hong Kong 9%, France 7.5%, Switzerland 7.4%, Japan 7.2%, US 4.4% (2017)",$18.89 billion,$0 ,$14.91 billion,$1.166 billion,patacas (MOP) per US dollar -,100% (2016),929 million kWh (2016 est.),5.077 billion kWh (2016 est.),0 kWh (2016 est.),4.306 billion kWh (2016 est.),"472,000 kW (2016 est.)",100% of total installed capacity (2016 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),0 bbl/day (2018 est.),0 bbl/day (2015 est.),0 bbl/day (2015 est.),0 bbl (1 January 2018 est.),0 bbl/day (2015 est.),"12,700 bbl/day (2016 est.)",0 bbl/day (2015 est.),"14,180 bbl/day (2015 est.)",0 cu m (2017 est.),178.2 million cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),175.5 million cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (1 January 2014 est.),2.563 million Mt (2017 est.),"142,000",24 (July 2016 est.),"1,969,972",327 (July 2016 est.),"modern communication facilities maintained for domestic and international services;&amp;nbsp;high mobile subscriber numbers&amp;nbsp;and mobile penetration with 4 network operators and a mobile virtual network operator&amp;nbsp;(MNVO), offering 4 G and LTE services; 5G wireless technology for commercial use in 2020, possible synchronizing with neighbouring regions (2018)",fixed-line 20 per 100 and mobile-celluar 344 per 100 persons (2018),"country code - 853; landing point for the SEA-ME-WE-3 submarine cable network that provides links to Asia, Africa, Australia, the Middle East, and Europe; HF radiotelephone communication facility; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Indian Ocean) (2019)","local government dominates broadcast media; 2 television stations operated by the government with one broadcasting in Portuguese and the other in Cantonese and Mandarin; 1 cable TV and 4 satellite TV services available; 3 radio stations broadcasting, of which 2 are government-operated (2019)",.mo,"460,000",77.6% (July 2016 est.),"177,959",30 (2017 est.),,no regular indigenous military forces,,1 (registered in China) (2015),17 (registered in China) (2015),"2,276,436 (2015)",25.435 million mt-km (2015),B-M (2016),1 (2013),1 (2017),1 (2017),,,,,,,,,,,2 (2013),,428 km (2017),428 km (2017),1,other 1 (2018),,,,&lt;p&gt;none&lt;/p&gt;,transshipment point for drugs going into mainland China; consumer of opiates and amphetamines,,,,,,,,35,,,,,,defense is the responsibility of China and the Chinese People&#39;s Liberation Army (PLA) maintains a garrison in Macau.,,,Macau,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not specified,,,,,12.40%,,,,,,special administrative region of the People&#39;s Republic of China,see China,none (Special Administrative Region of China),the US has no offices in Macau; US Consulate General in Hong Kong is accredited to Macau,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,25.90%,,,,,,,,,,$46.1 billion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,China 3 km,"Marine Dumping (associate member), Ship Pollution (associate member)",,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;note:&lt;/strong&gt; as a Special Administrative Region of China, &quot;Yiyongjun Jinxingqu&quot; is the official anthem (see China)&lt;/p&gt;",15%,,,,7.10%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Aomen Tebie Xingzhengqu (Chinese); Regiao Administrativa Especial de Macau (Portuguese),Aomen (Chinese); Macau (Portuguese),2.60%,20.3% (2013 est.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MDA,Moldova,MD,23-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;A large portion of present day Moldovan territory became a province of the Russian Empire in 1812 and then unified with Romania in 1918 in the aftermath of World War I. This territory was then incorporated into the Soviet Union at the close of World War II. Although Moldova has been independent from the Soviet Union since 1991, Russian forces have remained on Moldovan territory east of the Nistru River in the breakaway region of Transnistria, whose population is roughly equally composed of ethnic Ukrainians, Russians, and Moldovans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Years of Communist Party rule in Moldova from 2001-2009 ultimately ended with election-related violent protests and a rerun of parliamentary elections in 2009. Since then, a series of pro-European ruling coalitions have governed Moldova. As a result of the country&#39;s most recent legislative election in February 2019, parliamentary seats are split among the left-leaning Socialist Party (35 seats), the former ruling Democratic Party (30 seats), and the center-right ACUM bloc (26 seats). Parliament voted in Prime Minister Ion CHICU and his cabinet on 14 November 2019, two days after voting to remove his predecessor, ACUM co-leader Maia SANDU, who had been in office since June 2019.&lt;/p&gt;","Eastern Europe, northeast of Romania","47 00 N, 29 00 E",Europe,"33,851 sq km","32,891 sq km",960 sq km,slightly larger than Maryland,"1,885 km","Romania 683 km, Ukraine 1202 km",0 km (landlocked),,,,,"moderate winters, warm summers","rolling steppe, gradual slope south to Black Sea",139 m,Dniester (Nistru) 2 m,Dealul Balanesti 430 m,"lignite, phosphorites, gypsum, limestone, arable land",74.9% (2011 est.),55.1% (2011 est.),9.1% (2011 est.),10.7% (2011 est.),11.9% (2011 est.),13.2% (2011 est.),"2,283 sq km (2012)","pockets of agglomeration exist throughout the country, the largest being in the center of the country around the capital of Chisinau, followed by Tiraspol and Balti",landslides,"heavy use of agricultural chemicals, has contaminated soil and groundwater;

With a moderate climate and productive farmland, Moldova&#39;s economy relies heavily on its agriculture sector, featuring fruits, vegetables, wine, wheat, and tobacco. Moldova also depends on annual remittances of about $1.2 billion - almost 15% of GDP - from the roughly one million Moldovans working in Europe, Israel, Russia, and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With few natural energy resources, Moldova imports almost all of its energy supplies from Russia and Ukraine. Moldova&#39;s dependence on Russian energy is underscored by a more than $6 billion debt to Russian natural gas supplier Gazprom, largely the result of unreimbursed natural gas consumption in the breakaway region of Transnistria. Moldova and Romania inaugurated the Ungheni-Iasi natural gas interconnector project in August 2014. The 43-kilometer pipeline between Moldova and Romania, allows for both the import and export of natural gas. Several technical and regulatory delays kept gas from flowing into Moldova until March 2015. Romanian gas exports to Moldova are largely symbolic. In 2018, Moldova awarded a tender to Romanian Transgaz to construct a pipeline connecting Ungheni to Chisinau, bringing the gas to Moldovan population centers. Moldova also seeks to connect with the European power grid by 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government&#39;s stated goal of EU integration has resulted in some market-oriented progress. Moldova experienced better than expected economic growth in 2017, largely driven by increased consumption, increased revenue from agricultural exports, and improved tax collection. During fall 2014, Moldova signed an Association Agreement and a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with the EU (AA/DCFTA), connecting Moldovan products to the worldâ€™s largest market. The EU AA/DCFTA has contributed to significant growth in Moldovaâ€™s exports to the EU. In 2017, the EU purchased over 65% of Moldovaâ€™s exports, a major change from 20 years previously when the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) received over 69% of Moldovaâ€™s exports. A $1 billion asset-stripping heist of Moldovan banks in late 2014 delivered a significant shock to the economy in 2015; the subsequent bank bailout increased inflationary pressures and contributed to the depreciation of the leu and a minor recession. Moldovaâ€™s growth has also been hampered by endemic corruption, which limits business growth and deters foreign investment, and Russian restrictions on imports of Moldovaâ€™s agricultural products. The governmentâ€™s push to restore stability and implement meaningful reform led to the approval in 2016 of a $179 million three-year IMF program focused on improving the banking and fiscal environments, along with additional assistance programs from the EU, World Bank, and Romania.

MDG,Mongolia,MG,18-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;The Mongols gained fame in the 13th century when under Chinggis KHAAN they established a huge Eurasian empire through conquest. After his death the empire was divided into several powerful Mongol states, but these broke apart in the 14th century. The Mongols eventually retired to their original steppe homelands and in the late 17th century came under Chinese rule. Mongolia declared its independence from the Manchu-led Qing Empire in 1911 and achieved limited autonomy until 1919, when it again came under Chinese control. The Mongolian Revolution of 1921 ended Chinese dominance, and a communist regime, the Mongolian People&amp;rsquo;s Republic, took power in 1924.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The modern country of Mongolia, represents only part of the Mongols&#39; historical homeland; today, more ethnic Mongolians live in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in the People&#39;s Republic of China than in Mongolia. Since the country&#39;s peaceful democratic revolution in 1990, the ex-communist Mongolian People&#39;s Revolutionary Party (MPRP) - which took the name Mongolian People&amp;rsquo;s Party (MPP) in 2010 - has competed for political power with the Democratic Party (DP) and several other smaller parties, including a new party formed by former President ENKHBAYAR, which confusingly adopted for itself the MPRP name. In the country&#39;s most recent parliamentary elections in June 2016, Mongolians handed the MPP overwhelming control of Parliament, largely pushing out the DP, which had overseen a sharp decline in Mongolia&amp;rsquo;s economy during its control of Parliament in the preceding years. Mongolians elected a DP member, Khaltmaa BATTULGA, as president in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;","Northern Asia, between China and Russia","46 00 N, 105 00 E",Asia,"1,564,116 sq km","1,553,556 sq km","10,560 sq km",slightly smaller than Alaska;

Exports now account for more than 40% of GDP. Mongolia depends on China for more than 60% of its external trade - China receives some 90% of Mongolia&#39;s exports and supplies Mongolia with more than one-third of its imports. Mongolia also relies on Russia for 90% of its energy supplies, leaving it vulnerable to price increases. Remittances from Mongolians working abroad, particularly in South Korea, are significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soviet assistance, at its height one-third of GDP, disappeared almost overnight in 1990 and 1991 at the time of the dismantlement of the USSR. The following decade saw Mongolia endure both deep recession, because of political inaction, and natural disasters, as well as strong economic growth, because of market reforms and extensive privatization of the formerly state-run economy. The country opened a fledgling stock exchange in 1991. Mongolia joined the WTO in 1997 and seeks to expand its participation in regional economic and trade regimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growth averaged nearly 9% per year in 2004-08 largely because of high copper prices globally and new gold production. By late 2008, Mongolia was hit by the global financial crisis and Mongolia&#39;s real economy contracted 1.3% in 2009. In early 2009, the IMF reached a $236 million Stand-by Arrangement with Mongolia and it emerged from the crisis with a stronger banking sector and better fiscal management. In October 2009, Mongolia passed long-awaited legislation on an investment agreement to develop the Oyu Tolgoi (OT) mine, among the world&#39;s largest untapped copper-gold deposits. However, a dispute with foreign investors developing OT called into question the attractiveness of Mongolia as a destination for foreign investment. This caused a severe drop in FDI, and a slowing economy, leading to the dismissal of Prime Minister Norovyn ALTANKHUYAG in November 2014. The economy had grown more than 10% per year between 2011 and 2013 - largely on the strength of commodity exports and high government spending - before slowing to 7.8% in 2014, and falling to the 2% level in 2015. Growth rebounded from a brief 1.6% contraction in the third quarter of 2016 to 5.8% during the first three quarters of 2017, largely due to rising commodity prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The May 2015 agreement with Rio Tinto to restart the OT mine and the subsequent $4.4 billion finance package signing in December 2015 stemmed the loss of investor confidence. The current government has made restoring investor trust and reviving the economy its top priority, but has failed to invigorate the economy in the face of the large drop-off in foreign direct investment, mounting external debt, and a sizeable budget deficit. Mongolia secured a $5.5 billion financial assistance package from the IMF and a host of international creditors in May 2017, which is expected to improve Mongoliaâ€™s long-term fiscal and economic stability as long as Ulaanbaatar can advance the agreementâ€™s difficult contingent reforms, such as consolidating the governmentâ€™s off-balance sheet liabilities and rehabilitating the Mongolian banking sector.&lt;/p&gt;",$39.73 billion,$11.14 billion (2017 est.),5.10%,"$13,000 ",26.9% of GDP,49.2% (2017 est.),12.3% (2017 est.),23.8% (2017 est.),12.4% (2017 est.),59.5% (2017 est.),-57.1% (2017 est.),12.1% (2017 est.),38.2% (2017 est.),49.7% (2017 est.),"wheat, barley, vegetables, forage crops;

MKD,North Macedonia,MK,18-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;North Macedonia gained its independence peacefully from Yugoslavia in 1991 under the name of &quot;Macedonia.&quot; Greek objection to the new country&amp;rsquo;s name, insisting it implied territorial pretensions to the northern Greek province of Macedonia, and democratic backsliding for several years stalled the country&amp;rsquo;s movement toward Euro-Atlantic integration. Immediately after Macedonia declared independence, Greece sought to block Macedonian efforts to gain UN membership if the name &quot;Macedonia&quot; was used. The country was eventually admitted to the UN in 1993 as &quot;The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,&quot; and at the same time it agreed to UN-sponsored negotiations on the name dispute. In 1995, Greece lifted a 20-month trade embargo and the two countries agreed to normalize relations, but the issue of the name remained unresolved and negotiations for a solution continued. Over time, the US and over 130 other nations recognized Macedonia by its constitutional name, Republic of Macedonia. Ethnic Albanian grievances over perceived political and economic inequities escalated into a conflict in 2001 that eventually led to the internationally brokered Ohrid Framework Agreement, which ended the fighting and established guidelines for constitutional amendments and the creation of new laws that enhanced the rights of minorities. In January 2018, the government adopted a new law on languages, which elevated the Albanian language to an official language at the national level, with the Macedonian language remaining the sole official language in international relations. Relations between ethnic Macedonians and ethnic Albanians remain complicated, however.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;North Macedonia&#39;s pro-Western government has used its time in office since 2017 to sign a historic deal with Greece in June 2018 to end the name dispute and revive Skopje&#39;s NATO and EU membership prospects. This followed a nearly three-year political crisis that engulfed the country but ended in June 2017 following a six-month-long government formation period after a closely contested election in December 2016. The crisis began after the 2014 legislative and presidential election, and escalated in 2015 when the opposition party began releasing wiretapped material that revealed alleged widespread government corruption and abuse. Although an EU candidate since 2005, North Macedonia has yet to open EU accession negotiations. The country still faces challenges, including fully implementing reforms to overcome years of democratic backsliding and stimulating economic growth and development. In June 2018, Macedonia and Greece signed the Prespa Accord whereby the Republic of Macedonia agreed to change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia. Following ratification by both countries, the agreement went in to force on 12 February 2019. North Macedonia signed an accession protocol to become a NATO member state in February 2019.&lt;/p&gt;","Southeastern Europe, north of Greece","41 50 N, 22 00 E",Europe,"25,713 sq km","25,433 sq km",280 sq km,slightly larger than Vermont;

Its low tax rates and free economic zones have helped to attract foreign investment, which is still low relative to the rest of Europe. Corruption and weak rule of law remain significant problems. Some businesses complain of opaque regulations and unequal enforcement of the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macedoniaâ€™s economy is closely linked to Europe as a customer for exports and source of investment, and has suffered as a result of prolonged weakness in the euro zone. Unemployment has remained consistently high at about 23%, but may be overstated based on the existence of an extensive gray market, estimated to be between 20% and 45% of GDP, which is not captured by official statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macedonia is working to build a country-wide natural gas pipeline and distribution network. Currently, Macedonia receives its small natural gas supplies from Russia via Bulgaria. In 2016, Macedonia signed a memorandum of understanding with Greece to build an interconnector that could connect to the Trans Adriatic Pipeline that will traverse the region once complete, or to an LNG import terminal in Greece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macedonia maintained macroeconomic stability through the global financial crisis by conducting prudent monetary policy, which keeps the domestic currency pegged to the euro, and inflation at a low level. However, in the last two years, the internal political crisis has hampered economic performance, with GDP growth slowing in 2016 and 2017, and both domestic private and public investments declining. Fiscal policies were lax, with unproductive public expenditures, including subsidies and pension increases, and rising guarantees for the debt of state owned enterprises, and fiscal targets were consistently missed. In 2017, public debt stabilized at about 47% of GDP, still relatively low compared to its Western Balkan neighbors and the rest of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;",$31.03 billion,$11.37 billion (2017 est.),0%,"$14,900 ",30.3% of GDP,65.6% (2017 est.),15.6% (2017 est.),13.6% (2017 est.),20.2% (2017 est.),54% (2017 est.),-69% (2017 est.),10.9% (2017 est.),26.6% (2017 est.),62.5% (2017 est.),"grapes, tobacco, vegetables, fruits; milk, eggs","food processing, beverages, textiles, chemicals, iron, steel, cement, energy, pharmaceuticals, automotive parts",-7.8% (2017 est.),"950,800 (2017 est.)",16.20%,29.20%,54.5% (2017 est.),22.40%,21.5% (2015 est.),1.70%,25% (2015 est.),3.295 billion (2017 est.),3.605 billion (2017 est.),29% (of GDP) (2017 est.),-2.7% (of GDP) (2017 est.),39.3% of GDP,calendar year,1.40%,3.75%,6.61%,$1.909 billion,$1.909 billion,$5.01 billion,$2.269 billion,-$151 million,$4.601 billion,"Germany 46.7%, Bulgaria 6.1%, Serbia 4.4%, Belgium 4.1% (2017)","foodstuffs, beverages, tobacco; textiles, miscellaneous manufactures, iron, steel; automotive parts",$6.63 billion,"machinery and equipment, automobiles, chemicals, fuels, food products","Germany 11.9%, UK 10%, Greece 8%, Serbia 7.1%, China 5.9%, Italy 5.5%, Turkey 4.5%, Bulgaria 4.3% (2017)",$2.755 billion,$7.685 billion,$6.8 billion,$849.1 million,Macedonian denars (MKD) per US dollar -,100% (2016),5.396 billion kWh (2016 est.),6.42 billion kWh (2016 est.),58.5 million kWh (2016 est.),2.191 billion kWh (2016 est.),1.828 million kW (2016 est.),60% of total installed capacity (2016 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),37% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),3% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),0 bbl/day (2018 est.),142 bbl/day (2015 est.),0 bbl/day (2015 est.),0 bbl (1 January 2018 est.),0 bbl/day (2015 est.),"21,000 bbl/day (2016 est.)","3,065 bbl/day (2015 est.)","23,560 bbl/day (2015 est.)",0 cu m (2017 est.),198.2 million cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),198.2 million cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (31 December 2016 est.),7.459 million Mt (2017 est.),"361,269",17 (2017 est.),"2,121,805",101 (2017 est.),being part of the EU pre-accession process has led to a stronger teledensity with closer regulatory framework and independent regulators; administrative ties with the European Union have led to progress; broadband services are widely available; more customers moving to fiber networks; 2 mobile network operators; end of roaming tariffs (2018),fixed-line 17 per 100 and mobile-cellular 101 per 100 subscriptions (2018),country code - 389,"public service TV broadcaster Macedonian Radio and Television operates 3 national terrestrial TV channels and 2 satellite TV channels; additionally, there are 10 regional TV stations that broadcast nationally using terrestrial transmitters, 54 TV channels with concession for cable TV, 9 regional TV stations with concessions for cable TV; 4 satellite TV channels broadcasting on a national level, 21 local commercial TV channels, and a large number of cable operators that offer domestic and international programming; the public radio broadcaster operates over 3 stations; there are 4 privately owned radio stations that broadcast nationally; 17 regional radio stations, and 49 local commercial radio stations (2019)",.mk,1.475 million,70.4% (July 2016 est.),"386,718",18 (2017 est.),1.19% of GDP,"Army of the Republic of North Macedonia (ARSM; includes General Staff and subordinate Joint Operational Command, Logistic Support Command, Training and Doctrine Command, Special Ops Regiment, Electronic Surveillance Center, and Air Surveillance Center) (2019)",18 years of age for voluntary military service; conscription abolished in 2008 (2013),,,,,Z3 (2016),10 (2013),8 (2017),,2 (2017),,,6 (2017),2 (2013),,,,1 (2013),1 (2013),,"262 km gas, 120 km oil (2017)","14,182 km (includes 290 km of expressways) (2017)","9,633 km (2017)",,,,,,&lt;p&gt;Kosovo and North Macedonia completed demarcation of their boundary in September 2008&lt;/p&gt;,"major transshipment point for Southwest Asian heroin and hashish; minor transit point for South American cocaine destined for Europe; although not a financial center and most criminal activity is thought to be domestic, money laundering is a problem due to a mostly cash-based economy and weak enforcement",26.8 years (2014 est.),40.2% (2011),,,,1.3% (2011),"+1hr, begins last Sunday in March; ends last Sunday in October",33.7,,,,,,,"4,549 km (2017)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,925 km (2017),925 km 1.435-m gauge (313 km electrified) (2017),,,,,571 (2018),,,,none (landlocked),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MLI,Mali,ML,19-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;The Sudanese Republic and Senegal became independent of France in 1960 as the Mali Federation. When Senegal withdrew after only a few months, what formerly made up the Sudanese Republic was renamed Mali. Rule by dictatorship was brought to a close in 1991 by a military coup that ushered in a period of democratic rule. President Alpha Oumar KONARE won Mali&#39;s first two democratic presidential elections in 1992 and 1997. In keeping with Mali&#39;s two-term constitutional limit, he stepped down in 2002 and was succeeded by Amadou Toumani TOURE, who was elected to a second term in a 2007 election that was widely judged to be free and fair. Malian returnees from Libya in 2011 exacerbated tensions in northern Mali, and Tuareg ethnic militias rebelled in January 2012. Low- and mid-level soldiers, frustrated with the poor handling of the rebellion, overthrew TOURE on 22 March. Intensive mediation efforts led by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) returned power to a civilian administration in April with the appointment of Interim President Dioncounda TRAORE.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The post-coup chaos led to rebels expelling the Malian military from the country&#39;s three northern regions and allowed Islamic militants to set up strongholds. Hundreds of thousands of northern Malians fled the violence to southern Mali and neighboring countries, exacerbating regional food shortages in host communities. A French-led international military intervention to retake the three northern regions began in January 2013 and within a month, most of the north had been retaken. In a democratic presidential election conducted in July and August of 2013, Ibrahim Boubacar KEITA was elected president. The Malian Government and northern armed groups signed an internationally mediated peace accord in June 2015, however, the parties to the peace accord have made little progress in the accord&#39;s implementation, despite a June 2017 target for its completion. Furthermore, extremist groups outside the peace process made steady inroads into rural areas of central Mali following the consolidation of three major terrorist organizations in March 2017. In central and northern Mali, terrorist groups have exploited age-old ethnic rivalries between pastoralists and sedentary communities and inflicted serious losses on the Malian military. Intercommunal violence incidents such as targeted killings occur with increasing regularity. KEITA was reelected president in 2018 in an election that was deemed credible by international observers, despite some security and logistic shortfalls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","interior Western Africa, southwest of Algeria, north of Guinea, Cote d&#39;Ivoire, and Burkina Faso, west of Niger","17 00 N, 4 00 W",Africa,"1,240,192 sq km","1,220,190 sq km","20,002 sq km",slightly less than twice the size of Texas,"7,908 km","Algeria 1359 km, Burkina Faso 1325 km, Cote d&#39;Ivoire 599 km, Guinea 1062 km, Mauritania 2236 km, Niger 838 km, Senegal 489 km",0 km (landlocked),,,,,"subtropical to arid;

The country&#39;s fiscal status fluctuates with gold and agricultural commodity prices and the harvest; cotton and gold exports make up around 80% of export earnings. Mali remains dependent on foreign aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economic activity is largely confined to the riverine area irrigated by the Niger River; about 65% of Maliâ€™s land area is desert or semidesert. About 10% of the population is nomadic and about 80% of the labor force is engaged in farming and fishing. Industrial activity is concentrated on processing farm commodities. The government subsidizes the production of cereals to decrease the countryâ€™s dependence on imported foodstuffs and to reduce its vulnerability to food price shocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mali is developing its iron ore extraction industry to diversify foreign exchange earnings away from gold, but the pace will depend on global price trends. Although the political coup in 2012 slowed Maliâ€™s growth, the economy has since bounced back, with GDP growth above 5% in 2014-17, although physical insecurity, high population growth, corruption, weak infrastructure, and low levels of human capital continue to constrain economic development. Higher rainfall helped to boost cotton output in 2017, and the countryâ€™s 2017 budget increased spending more than 10%, much of which was devoted to infrastructure and agriculture.

A young age structure, a declining mortality rate, and a sustained high total fertility rate of 6 children per woman â€“ the third highest in the world â€“ ensure continued rapid population growth for the foreseeable future. Significant outmigration only marginally tempers this growth. Despite decreases, Maliâ€™s infant, child, and maternal mortality rates remain among the highest in sub-Saharan Africa because of limited access to and adoption of family planning, early childbearing, short birth intervals, the prevalence of female genital cutting, infrequent use of skilled birth attendants, and a lack of emergency obstetrical and neonatal care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maliâ€™s high total fertility rate has been virtually unchanged for decades, as a result of the ongoing preference for large families, early childbearing, the lack of female education and empowerment, poverty, and extremely low contraceptive use. Slowing Maliâ€™s population growth by lowering its birth rate will be essential for poverty reduction, improving food security, and developing human capital and the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mali has a long history of seasonal migration and emigration driven by poverty, conflict, demographic pressure, unemployment, food insecurity, and droughts. Many Malians from rural areas migrate during the dry period to nearby villages and towns to do odd jobs or to adjoining countries to work in agriculture or mining. Pastoralists and nomads move seasonally to southern Mali or nearby coastal states. Others migrate long term to Maliâ€™s urban areas, Cote dâ€™Ivoire, other neighboring countries, and in smaller numbers to France, Maliâ€™s former colonial ruler. Since the early 1990s, Maliâ€™s role has grown as a transit country for regional migration flows and illegal migration to Europe. Human smugglers and traffickers exploit the same regional routes used for moving contraband drugs, arms, and cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between early 2012 and 2013, renewed fighting in northern Mali between government forces and Tuareg secessionists and their Islamist allies, a French-led international military intervention, as well as chronic food shortages, caused the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Malians. Most of those displaced domestically sought shelter in urban areas of southern Mali, except for pastoralist and nomadic groups, who abandoned their traditional routes, gave away or sold their livestock, and dispersed into the deserts of northern Mali or crossed into neighboring countries. Almost all Malians who took refuge abroad (mostly Tuareg and Maure pastoralists) stayed in the region, largely in Mauritania, Niger, and Burkina Faso.&lt;/p&gt;",593 km (2014),,593 km 1.000-m gauge (2014),,,,,"Mali is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking; internal trafficking is more prevalent than transnational trafficking, but foreign women and girls are forced into domestic servitude, agricultural labor, and support roles in gold mines, as well as subjected to sex trafficking; Malian boys are forced to work in agricultural settings, gold mines, the informal commercial sector and to beg within Mali and neighboring countries; Malians and other Africans who travel through Mali to Mauritania, Algeria, or Libya in hopes of reaching Europe are particularly at risk of becoming victims of human trafficking; men and boys, primarily of Songhai ethnicity, are subjected to debt bondage in the salt mines of Taoudenni in northern Mali; some members of Mali&#39;s Tamachek community are subjected to hereditary slavery-related practices; Malian women and girls are victims of sex trafficking in Gabon, Libya, Lebanon, and Tunisia; the recruitment of child soldiers by armed groups in northern Mali decreased","Tier 2 Watch List - Mali does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so; in 2014, Mali was granted a waiver from an otherwise required downgrade to Tier 3 because its government has a written plan that, if implemented would constitute making significant efforts to bring itself into compliance with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; officials failed to distribute the 2012 anti-trafficking law to judicial and law enforcement personnel, perpetuating a lack of understanding and awareness of the legislation; anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts decreased in 2014, with only one case investigated and no prosecutions or convictions; fewer victims were identified, and the government did not support the privately funded NGOs and international organizations it relied upon to provide victims with services; the government did not conduct any awareness-raising campaigns, workshops, or training sessions (2015)","139,107 km (2018)",none (landlocked),,,schistosomiasis (2016),rabies (2016),20% (2005 est.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,meningococcal meningitis (2016),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"&lt;strong&gt;aim(s): &lt;/strong&gt;implement ISIS&#39;s strict interpretation of Sharia; replace the Malian Government with an Islamic state&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;area(s) of operation: &lt;/strong&gt;headquartered in the north; targets primarily international interests, especially Westerners and Western entities&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (2018)","&lt;strong&gt;aim(s):&lt;/strong&gt; establish an Islamic state centered in Mali&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;area(s) of operation:&lt;/strong&gt; primarily based in northern and central Mali; targets Western and local interests in West Africa and Sahel; has claimed responsibility for attacks in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;note:&lt;/strong&gt; pledged allegiance to al-Qa&#39;ida and AQIM; holds Western hostages; wages attacks against security and peacekeeping forces in Mali ( 2018)",&lt;strong&gt;aim(s):&lt;/strong&gt; replace regional governments with an Islamic state&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;area(s) of operation:&lt;/strong&gt; mostly concentrated along the Mali-Niger border region; targets primarily security forces (2018),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(The March of Monaco),Louis NOTARI/Charles ALBRECHT,"&lt;p&gt;Monaco, bordering France on the Mediterranean coast, is a popular resort, attracting tourists to its casino and pleasant climate. The principality also is a banking center and has successfully sought to diversify into services and small, high-value-added, nonpolluting industries. The state retains monopolies in a number of sectors, including tobacco, the telephone network, and the postal service. Living standards are high, roughly comparable to those in prosperous French metropolitan areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state has no income tax and low business taxes and thrives as a tax haven both for individuals who have established residence and for foreign companies that have set up businesses and offices. Monaco, however, is not a tax-free shelter; it charges nearly 20% value-added tax, collects stamp duties, and companies face a 33% tax on profits unless they can show that three-quarters of profits are generated within the principality. Monaco was formally removed from the OECD&#39;s &quot;grey list&quot; of uncooperative tax jurisdictions in late 2009, but continues to face international pressure to abandon its banking secrecy laws and help combat tax evasion. In October 2014, Monaco officially became the 84th jurisdiction participating in the OECDâ€™s Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, an effort to combat offshore tax avoidance and evasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monaco&#39;s reliance on tourism and banking for its economic growth has left it vulnerable to downturns in France and other European economies which are the principality&#39;s main trade partners.

MAC,Morocco,MO,18-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;In 788, about a century after the Arab conquest of North Africa, a series of Moroccan Muslim dynasties began to rule in Morocco. In the 16th century, the Sa&#39;adi monarchy, particularly under Ahmad al-MANSUR (1578-1603), repelled foreign invaders and inaugurated a golden age. The Alaouite Dynasty, to which the current Moroccan royal family belongs, dates from the 17th century. In 1860, Spain occupied northern Morocco and ushered in a half-century of trade rivalry among European powers that saw Morocco&#39;s sovereignty steadily erode; in 1912, the French imposed a protectorate over the country. A protracted independence struggle with France ended successfully in 1956. The internationalized city of Tangier and most Spanish possessions were turned over to the new country that same year. Sultan MOHAMMED V, the current monarch&#39;s grandfather, organized the new state as a constitutional monarchy and in 1957 assumed the title of king. Since Spain&#39;s 1976 withdrawal from what is today called Western Sahara, Morocco has extended its de facto administrative control to roughly 75% of this territory; however, the UN does not recognize Morocco as the administering power for Western Sahara. The UN since 1991 has monitored a cease-fire between Morocco and the Polisario Front - an organization advocating the territory&amp;rsquo;s independence - and restarted negotiations over the status of the territory in December 2018.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;King MOHAMMED VI in early 2011 responded to the spread of pro-democracy protests in the region by implementing a reform program that included a new constitution, passed by popular referendum in July 2011, under which some new powers were extended to parliament and the prime minister, but ultimate authority remains in the hands of the monarch. In November 2011, the Justice and Development Party (PJD) - a moderate Islamist party - won the largest number of seats in parliamentary elections, becoming the first Islamist party to lead the Moroccan Government. In September 2015, Morocco held its first direct elections for regional councils, one of the reforms included in the 2011 constitution. The PJD again won the largest number of seats in nationwide parliamentary elections in October 2016.&lt;/p&gt;","Northern Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, between Algeria and Western Sahara","32 00 N, 5 00 W",Africa,"446,550 sq km","446,300 sq km",250 sq km,slightly more than three times the size of New York;

Key sectors of the economy include agriculture, tourism, aerospace, automotive, phosphates, textiles, apparel, and subcomponents. Morocco has increased investment in its port, transportation, and industrial infrastructure to position itself as a center and broker for business throughout Africa. Industrial development strategies and infrastructure improvements - most visibly illustrated by a new port and free trade zone near Tangier - are improving Morocco&#39;s competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s, Morocco was a heavily indebted country before pursuing austerity measures and pro-market reforms, overseen by the IMF. Since taking the throne in 1999, King MOHAMMED VI has presided over a stable economy marked by steady growth, low inflation, and gradually falling unemployment, although poor harvests and economic difficulties in Europe contributed to an economic slowdown. To boost exports, Morocco entered into a bilateral Free Trade Agreement with the US in 2006 and an Advanced Status agreement with the EU in 2008. In late 2014, Morocco eliminated subsidies for gasoline, diesel, and fuel oil, dramatically reducing outlays that weighed on the countryâ€™s budget and current account. Subsidies on butane gas and certain food products remain in place. Morocco also seeks to expand its renewable energy capacity with a goal of making renewable more than 50% of installed electricity generation capacity by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Morocco&#39;s economic progress, the country suffers from high unemployment, poverty, and illiteracy, particularly in rural areas.

Its population is growing but at a declining rate, as people live longer and women have fewer children. Infant, child, and maternal mortality rates have been reduced through better health care, nutrition, hygiene, and vaccination coverage, although disparities between urban and rural and rich and poor households persist. Moroccoâ€™s shrinking child cohort reflects the decline of its total fertility rate from 5 in mid-1980s to 2.2 in 2010, which is a result of increased female educational attainment, higher contraceptive use, delayed marriage, and the desire for smaller families. Young adults (persons aged 15-29) make up almost 26% of the total population and represent a potential economic asset if they can be gainfully employed. Currently, however, many youths are unemployed because Moroccoâ€™s job creation rate has not kept pace with the growth of its working-age population. Most youths who have jobs work in the informal sector with little security or benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the second half of the 20th century, Morocco became one of the worldâ€™s top emigration countries, creating large, widely dispersed migrant communities in Western Europe. The Moroccan Government has encouraged emigration since its independence in 1956, both to secure remittances for funding national development and as an outlet to prevent unrest in rebellious (often Berber) areas. Although Moroccan labor migrants earlier targeted Algeria and France, the flood of Moroccan &quot;guest workers&quot; from the mid-1960s to the early 1970s spread widely across northwestern Europe to fill unskilled jobs in the booming manufacturing, mining, construction, and agriculture industries. Host societies and most Moroccan migrants expected this migration to be temporary, but deteriorating economic conditions in Morocco related to the 1973 oil crisis and tighter European immigration policies resulted in these stays becoming permanent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wave of family migration followed in the 1970s and 1980s, with a growing number of second generation Moroccans opting to become naturalized citizens of their host countries. Spain and Italy emerged as new destination countries in the mid-1980s, but their introduction of visa restrictions in the early 1990s pushed Moroccans increasingly to migrate either legally by marrying Moroccans already in Europe or illegally to work in the underground economy. Women began to make up a growing share of these labor migrants. At the same time, some higher-skilled Moroccans went to the US and Quebec, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the mid-1990s, Morocco developed into a transit country for asylum seekers from sub-Saharan Africa and illegal labor migrants from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia trying to reach Europe via southern Spain, Spainâ€™s Canary Islands, or Spainâ€™s North African enclaves, Ceuta and Melilla. Forcible expulsions by Moroccan and Spanish security forces have not deterred these illegal migrants or calmed Europeâ€™s security concerns. Rabat remains unlikely to adopt an EU agreement to take back third-country nationals who have entered the EU illegally via Morocco. Thousands of other illegal migrants have chosen to stay in Morocco until they earn enough money for further travel or permanently as a &quot;second-best&quot; option. The launching of a regularization program in 2014 legalized the status of some migrants and granted them equal access to education, health care, and work, but xenophobia and racism remain obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;","2,067 km (2014)","2,067 km 1.435-m gauge (1,022 km electrified) (2014)",,,,,,,,"57,300 km (2018)",,,,,,,,Jorf Lasfar,,,,,,,,,"the University of al-Quarawiyyin Library in Fez is recognized as the oldest existing, continually operating library in the world, dating back to A.D. 859; among its holdings are approximately 4,000 ancient Islamic manuscripts (2018)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The French assumed control in 1715, developing the island into an important naval base overseeing Indian Ocean trade, and establishing a plantation economy of sugar cane. The British captured the island in 1810, during the Napoleonic Wars. Mauritius remained a strategically important British naval base, and later an air station, playing an important role during World War II for anti-submarine and convoy operations, as well as the collection of signals intelligence. Independence from the UK was attained in 1968.

Mauritius has achieved steady growth over the last several decades, resulting in more equitable income distribution, increased life expectancy, lowered infant mortality, and a much-improved infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The economy currently depends on sugar, tourism, textiles and apparel, and financial services, but is expanding into fish processing, information and communications technology, education, and hospitality and property development. Sugarcane is grown on about 90% of the cultivated land area but sugar makes up only around 3-4% of national GDP. Authorities plan to emphasize services and innovation in the coming years. After several years of slow growth, government policies now seek to stimulate economic growth in five areas: serving as a gateway for international investment into Africa; increasing the use of renewable energy; developing smart cities; growing the ocean economy; and upgrading and modernizing infrastructure, including public transportation, the port, and the airport.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mauritius has attracted more than 32,000 offshore entities, many aimed at commerce in India, South Africa, and China. The Mauritius International Financial Center is under scrutiny by international bodies promoting fair tax competition and Mauritius has been cooperating with the European Union and the United states in the automatic exchange of account information. Mauritius is also a member of the OECD/G20&amp;rsquo;s Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting and is under pressure to review its Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements. The offshore sector is vulnerable to changes in the tax framework and authorities have been working on a Financial Services Sector Blueprint to enable Mauritius to transition to a jurisdiction of higher value added. Mauritius&amp;rsquo; textile sector has taken advantage of the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, a preferential trade program that allows duty free access to the US market, with Mauritian exports to the US growing by 35.6 % from 2000 to 2014. However, lack of local labor as well as rising labor costs eroding the competitiveness of textile firms in Mauritius.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mauritius&#39; sound economic policies and prudent banking practices helped mitigate negative effects of the global financial crisis in 2008-09. GDP grew in the 3-4% per year range in 2010-17, and the country continues to expand its trade and investment outreach around the globe. Growth in the US and Europe fostered goods and services exports, including tourism, while lower oil prices kept inflation low. Mauritius continues to rank as one of the most business-friendly environments on the continent and passed a Business Facilitation Act to improve competitiveness and long-term growth prospects. A new National Economic Development Board was set up in 2017-2018 to spearhead efforts to promote exports and attract inward investment.&lt;/p&gt;",$28.27 billion,$13.33 billion (2017 est.),3.80%,"$22,300 ",16.9% of GDP,81% (2017 est.),15.1% (2017 est.),17.3% (2017 est.),-0.4% (2017 est.),42.1% (2017 est.),-55.1% (2017 est.),4% (2017 est.),21.8% (2017 est.),74.1% (2017 est.),"sugarcane, tea, corn, potatoes, bananas, pulses; cattle, goats; fish","food processing (largely sugar milling), textiles, clothing, mining, chemicals, metal products, transport equipment, nonelectrical machinery, tourism",3.2% (2017 est.),"633,900 (2017 est.)",8%,29.80%,62.2% (2014 est.),7.10%,8% (2006 est.), NA, NA,2.994 billion (2017 est.),3.038 billion (2017 est.),22.5% (of GDP) (2017 est.),-0.3% (of GDP) (2017 est.),64% of GDP,1 July - 30 June,3.70%,9%,8.50%,$2.833 billion,$2.833 billion,$13.7 billion,$8.942 billion,-$875 million,$2.36 billion,"France 16.7%, US 12.5%, UK 12%, South Africa 9%, Madagascar 6.7%, Italy 6.6%, Spain 5.2% (2017)","clothing and textiles, sugar, cut flowers, molasses, fish, primates (for research)",$4.986 billion,"manufactured goods, capital equipment, foodstuffs, petroleum products, chemicals","India 17.9%, China 15.7%, France 11.1%, South Africa 9.7% (2017)",$4.967 billion,$14.34 billion,&lt;p&gt;NA&lt;/p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;NA&lt;/p&gt;,Mauritian rupees (MUR) per US dollar -,100% (2016),2.898 billion kWh (2016 est.),2.726 billion kWh (2016 est.),0 kWh (2016 est.),0 kWh (2016 est.),"894,000 kW (2016 est.)",79% of total installed capacity (2016 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),7% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),14% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),0 bbl/day (2018 est.),0 bbl/day (2015 est.),0 bbl/day (2015 est.),0 bbl (1 January 2018 est.),0 bbl/day (2017 est.),"27,000 bbl/day (2016 est.)",0 bbl/day (2015 est.),"26,960 bbl/day (2015 est.)",0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (1 January 2014 est.),6.429 million Mt (2017 est.),"413,100",30 (2017 est.),"1,839,500",136 (2017 est.),"small system with good service; LTE and fiber broadband service are available; government building a national Wi-Fi network; partial privatization of biggest telecommunications company, open to competition (2018)",fixed-line teledensity roughly 30 per 100 persons; mobile-cellular services&amp;nbsp; teledensity approaching 136 per 100 persons (2018),"country code - 230; landing points for the SAFE, MARS, IOX Cable System, METISS&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and LION submarine cable system that provides links to Asia, Africa, Southeast Asia, Indian Ocean Islands of Reunion, Madagascar, and Mauritius; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Indian Ocean); new microwave link to Reunion; HF radiotelephone links to several countries (2019)","the government maintains control over TV broadcasting through the Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation (MBC), which only operates digital TV stations since June 2015; MBC is a shareholder in a local company that operates 2 pay-TV stations; the state retains the largest radio broadcast network with multiple stations; several private radio broadcasters have entered the market since 2001; transmissions of at least 2 international broadcasters are available (2019)",.mu,"717,618",53.2% (July 2016 est.),"246,000",18 (2017 est.),0.16% of GDP,no regular military forces; Mauritius Police Force includes a Special Mobile Force (a paramilitary force formed as a mobile infantry battalion) and the National Coast Guard (2019),,1 (2015),13 (2015),"1,466,527 (2015)",168.773 million mt-km (2015),3B (2016),5 (2013),2 (2017),1 (2017),,,1 (2017),,3 (2013),,,,2 (2013),1 (2013),,,"2,428 km (2015)","2,379 km (includes 99 km of expressways) (2015)",28,"general cargo 1, oil tanker 4, other 23 (2018)",,,,&lt;p&gt;Mauritius and Seychelles claim the Chagos Islands; claims French-administered Tromelin Island&lt;/p&gt;,"consumer and transshipment point for heroin from South Asia; small amounts of cannabis produced and consumed locally; significant offshore financial industry creates potential for money laundering, but corruption levels are relatively low and the government appears generally to be committed to regulating its banking industry",,63.8% (2014),,,,,,35.9,,,,,,,49 km (2015),,Port Louis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"&lt;p&gt;Mauritius has transitioned from a country of high fertility and high mortality rates in the 1950s and mid-1960s to one with among the lowest population growth rates in the developing world today. After World War II, Mauritiusâ€™ population began to expand quickly due to increased fertility and a dramatic drop in mortality rates as a result of improved health care and the eradication of malaria. This period of heightened population growth â€“ reaching about 3% a year â€“ was followed by one of the worldâ€™s most rapid birth rate declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total fertility rate fell from 6.2 children per women in 1963 to 3.2 in 1972 â€“ largely the result of improved educational attainment, especially among young women, accompanied by later marriage and the adoption of family planning methods. The family planning programsâ€™ success was due to support from the government and eventually the traditionally pronatalist religious communities, which both recognized that controlling population growth was necessary because of Mauritiusâ€™ small size and limited resources. Mauritiusâ€™ fertility rate has consistently been below replacement level since the late 1990s, a rate that is substantially lower than nearby countries in southern Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With no indigenous population, Mauritiusâ€™ ethnic mix is a product of more than two centuries of European colonialism and continued international labor migration. Sugar production relied on slave labor mainly from Madagascar, Mozambique, and East Africa from the early 18th century until its abolition in 1835, when slaves were replaced with indentured Indians. Most of the influx of indentured labor â€“ peaking between the late 1830s and early 1860 â€“ settled permanently creating massive population growth of more than 7% a year and reshaping the islandâ€™s social and cultural composition. While Indians represented about 12% of Mauritiusâ€™ population in 1837, they and their descendants accounted for roughly two-thirds by the end of the 19th century. Most were Hindus, but the majority of the free Indian traders were Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mauritius again turned to overseas labor when its success in clothing and textile exports led to a labor shortage in the mid-1980s. Clothing manufacturers brought in contract workers (increasingly women) from China, India, and, to a lesser extent Bangladesh and Madagascar, who worked longer hours for lower wages under poor conditions and were viewed as more productive than locals. Downturns in the sugar and textile industries in the mid-2000s and a lack of highly qualified domestic workers for Mauritiusâ€™ growing services sector led to the emigration of low-skilled workers and a reliance on skilled foreign labor. Since 2007, Mauritius has pursued a circular migration program to enable citizens to acquire new skills and savings abroad and then return home to start businesses and to invest in the countryâ€™s development.&lt;/p&gt;",,,,,,,,"Mauritius is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking; Mauritian girls are induced or sold into prostitution, often by peers, family members, or businessmen offering other forms of employment; Mauritian adults have been identified as labor trafficking victims in the UK, Belgium, and Canada, while Mauritian women from Rodrigues Island are also subject to domestic servitude in Mauritius; Malagasy women transit Mauritius en route to the Middle East for jobs as domestic servants and subsequently are subjected to forced labor; Cambodian men are victims of forced labor on foreign fishing vessels in Mauritiusâ€™ territorial waters; other migrant workers from East and South Asia and Madagascar are also subject to forced labor in Mauritiusâ€™ manufacturing and construction sectors","Tier 2 Watch List â€“ Mauritius does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so; in 2014, the government made modest efforts to address child sex trafficking but none related to adult forced labor; law enforcement lacks an understanding of trafficking crimes outside of child sex trafficking, despite increasing evidence of other forms of human trafficking; authorities made no trafficking prosecutions or convictions and made modest efforts to assist a couple of child sex trafficking victims; officials sustained an extensive public awareness campaign to prevent child sex trafficking, but no efforts were made to raise awareness or reduce demand for forced adult or child labor (2015)",,,,,,,,,,,0 km,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MRT,Mauritania,MR,18-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;Independent from France in 1960, Mauritania annexed the southern third of the former Spanish Sahara (now Western Sahara) in 1976 but relinquished it after three years of raids by the Polisario guerrilla front seeking independence for the territory. Maaouya Ould Sid Ahmed TAYA seized power in a coup in 1984 and ruled Mauritania with a heavy hand for more than two decades. A series of presidential elections that he held were widely seen as flawed. A bloodless coup in August 2005 deposed President TAYA and ushered in a military council that oversaw a transition to democratic rule. Independent candidate Sidi Ould Cheikh ABDALLAHI was inaugurated in April 2007 as Mauritania&#39;s first freely and fairly elected president. His term ended prematurely in August 2008 when a military junta led by General Mohamed Ould Abdel AZIZ deposed him and installed a military council government. AZIZ was subsequently elected president in July 2009 and sworn in the following month. AZIZ sustained injuries from an accidental shooting by his own troops in October 2012 but has continued to maintain his authority. He was reelected in 2014 to a second and final term as president (according to the present constitution). AZIZ will be replaced through elections scheduled for June 2019. The country continues to experience ethnic tensions among three major groups: Arabic-speaking descendants of slaves (Haratines), Arabic-speaking &quot;White Moors&quot; (Beydane), and members of Sub-Saharan ethnic groups mostly originating in the Senegal River valley (Halpulaar, Soninke, and Wolof).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) launched a series of attacks in Mauritania between 2005 and 2011, murdering American and foreign tourists and aid workers, attacking diplomatic and government facilities, and ambushing Mauritanian soldiers and gendarmes. A successful strategy against terrorism that combines dialogue with the terrorists and military actions has prevented the country from further terrorist attacks since 2011. However, AQIM and similar groups remain active in neighboring Mali and elsewhere in the Sahel region and continue to pose a threat to Mauritanians and foreign visitors.&lt;/p&gt;","Western Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between Senegal and Western Sahara","20 00 N, 12 00 W",Africa,"1,030,700 sq km","1,030,700 sq km",0 sq km,slightly larger than three times the size of New Mexico;

Half the population still depends on farming and raising livestock, even though many nomads and subsistence farmers were forced into the cities by recurrent droughts in the 1970s, 1980s, 2000s, and 2017. Recently, GDP growth has been driven largely by foreign investment in the mining and oil sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mauritania&#39;s extensive mineral resources include iron ore, gold, copper, gypsum, and phosphate rock, and exploration is ongoing for tantalum, uranium, crude oil, and natural gas. Extractive commodities make up about three-quarters of Mauritania&#39;s total exports, subjecting the economy to price swings in world commodity markets. Mining is also a growing source of government revenue, rising from 13% to 30% of total revenue from 2006 to 2014. The nation&#39;s coastal waters are among the richest fishing areas in the world, and fishing accounts for about 15% of budget revenues, 45% of foreign currency earnings. Mauritania processes a total of 1,800,000 tons of fish per year, but overexploitation by foreign and national fleets threaten the sustainability of this key source of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economy is highly sensitive to international food and extractive commodity prices. Other risks to Mauritania&#39;s economy include its recurring droughts, dependence on foreign aid and investment, and insecurity in neighboring Mali, as well as significant shortages of infrastructure, institutional capacity, and human capital. In December 2017, Mauritania and the IMF agreed to a three year agreement under the Extended Credit Facility to foster economic growth, maintain macroeconomic stability, and reduce poverty.

Mauritania&#39;s large youth cohort is vital to its development prospects, but available schooling does not adequately prepare students for the workplace. Girls continue to be underrepresented in the classroom, educational quality remains poor, and the dropout rate is high. The literacy rate is only about 50%, even though access to primary education has improved since the mid-2000s. Women&#39;s restricted access to education and discriminatory laws maintain gender inequality - worsened by early and forced marriages and female genital cutting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The denial of education to black Moors also helps to perpetuate slavery. Although Mauritania abolished slavery in 1981 (the last country in the world to do so) and made it a criminal offense in 2007, the millenniums-old practice persists largely because anti-slavery laws are rarely enforced and the custom is so ingrained.&amp;nbsp; According to a 2018 nongovernmental organization&#39;s report, a little more than 2% of Mauritania&#39;s population is enslaved, which includes individuals sujbected to forced labor and forced marriage, although many thousands of individuals who are legally free contend with discrimination, poor education, and a lack of identity papers and, therefore, live in de facto slavery.&amp;nbsp; The UN and international press outlets have claimed that up to 20% of Mauritania&#39;s population is enslaved, which would be the highest rate worldwide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drought, poverty, and unemployment have driven outmigration from Mauritania since the 1970s. Early flows were directed toward other West African countries, including Senegal, Mali, Cote d&#39;Ivoire, and Gambia. The 1989 Mauritania-Senegal conflict forced thousands of black Mauritanians to take refuge in Senegal and pushed labor migrants toward the Gulf, Libya, and Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Mauritania has accepted migrants from neighboring countries to fill labor shortages since its independence in 1960 and more recently has received refugees escaping civil wars, including tens of thousands of Tuaregs who fled Mali in 2012.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mauritania was an important transit point for sub-Saharan migrants moving illegally to North Africa and Europe. In the mid-2000s, as border patrols increased in the Strait of Gibraltar, security increased around Spain&#39;s North African enclaves (Ceuta and Melilla), and Moroccan border controls intensified, illegal migration flows shifted from the Western Mediterranean to Spain&#39;s Canary Islands. In 2006, departure points moved southward along the West African coast from Morocco and Western Sahara to Mauritania&#39;s two key ports (Nouadhibou and the capital Nouakchott), and illegal migration to the Canaries peaked at almost 32,000. The numbers fell dramatically in the following years because of joint patrolling off the West African coast by Frontex (the EU&#39;s border protection agency), Spain, Mauritania, and Senegal; the expansion of Spain&#39;s border surveillance system; and the 2008 European economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;",728 km (2014),728 km 1.435-m gauge (2014),,,,,"26,001 (Western Saharan Sahrawis) (2018); 56,668 (Mali) (2019)","Mauritania is a source and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking; adults and children from traditional slave castes are subjected to slavery-related practices rooted in ancestral master-slave relationships; Mauritanian boy students called talibes are trafficked within the country by religious teachers for forced begging; Mauritanian girls, as well as girls from Mali, Senegal, The Gambia, and other West African countries, are forced into domestic servitude; Mauritanian women and girls are forced into prostitution domestically or transported to countries in the Middle East for the same purpose, sometimes through forced marriages","Tier 3 - Mauritania does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so; anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts were negligible; one slavery case identified by an NGO was investigated, but no prosecutions or convictions were made, including among the 4,000 child labor cases NGOs referred to the police; the 2007 anti-slavery law remains ineffective because it requires slaves, most of whom are illiterate, to file their own legal complaint, and the government agency that can submit claims on them did not file any in 2014; authorities arrested, prosecuted, and convicted several anti-slavery activists; NGOs continued to provide the majority of protective services to trafficking victims without support from the government; some steps were taken to raise public awareness about human trafficking (2015)",,,,,,rabies (2016),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,meningococcal meningitis (2016),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Situated in the center of the Mediterranean, Maltaâ€™s islands have long served as a strategic military asset, with the islands at various times having come under control of the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Moors, Normans, Sicilians, Spanish, Knights of St. John, and the French. Most recently a British colony (since 1814), Malta gained its independence in 1964 and declared itself a republic ten years later. While under British rule, the island staunchly supported the UK through both world wars. Since about the mid-1980s, the island has transformed itself into a freight transshipment point, a financial center, and a tourist destination while its key industries moved toward more service-oriented activities.

Malta produces less than a quarter of its food needs, has limited fresh water supplies, and has few domestic energy sources. Malta&#39;s economy is dependent on foreign trade, manufacturing, and tourism. Malta joined the EU in 2004 and adopted the euro on 1 January 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malta has weathered the euro-zone crisis better than most EU member states due to a low debt-to-GDP ratio and financially sound banking sector. It maintains one of the lowest unemployment rates in Europe, and growth has fully recovered since the 2009 recession. In 2014 through 2016, Malta led the euro zone in growth, expanding more than 4.5% per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maltaâ€™s services sector continues to grow, with sustained growth in the financial services and online gaming sectors. Advantageous tax schemes remained attractive to foreign investors, though EU discussions of anti-tax avoidance measures have raised concerns among Maltaâ€™s financial services and insurance providers, as the measures could have a significant impact on those sectors. The tourism sector also continued to grow, with 2016 showing record-breaking numbers of both air and cruise passenger arrivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maltaâ€™s GDP growth remains strong and is supported by a strong labor market. The government has implemented new programs, including free childcare, to encourage increased labor participation. The high cost of borrowing and small labor market remain potential constraints to future economic growth. Increasingly, other EU and European migrants are relocating to Malta for employment, though wages have remained low compared to other European countries.

MUS,Oman,MU,18-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;The inhabitants of the area of Oman have long prospered from Indian Ocean trade. In the late 18th century, the nascent sultanate in Muscat signed the first in a series of friendship treaties with Britain. Over time, Oman&#39;s dependence on British political and military advisors increased, although the sultanate never became a British colony. In 1970, QABOOS bin Said Al-Said overthrew his father, and has since ruled as sultan. Sultan QABOOS has no children and has not designated a successor publicly; the Basic Law of 1996 outlines Oman&amp;rsquo;s succession procedure. Sultan QABOOS&amp;rsquo; extensive modernization program opened the country to the outside world, and the sultan has prioritized strategic ties with the UK and US. Oman&#39;s moderate, independent foreign policy has sought to maintain good relations with its neighbors and to avoid external entanglements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by the popular uprisings that swept the Middle East and North Africa beginning in January 2011, some Omanis staged demonstrations, calling for more jobs and economic benefits and an end to corruption. In response to those protester demands, QABOOS in 2011 pledged to implement economic and political reforms, such as granting Oman&amp;rsquo;s bicameral legislative body more power and authorizing direct elections for its lower house, which took place in November 2011. Additionally, the Sultan increased unemployment benefits, and, in August 2012, issued a royal directive mandating the speedy implementation of a national job creation plan for thousands of public and private sector Omani jobs. As part of the government&#39;s efforts to decentralize authority and allow greater citizen participation in local governance, Oman successfully conducted its first municipal council elections in December 2012. Announced by the sultan in 2011, the municipal councils have the power to advise the Royal Court on the needs of local districts across Oman&#39;s 11 governorates.&lt;/p&gt;","Middle East, bordering the Arabian Sea, Gulf of Oman, and Persian Gulf, between Yemen and the UAE","21 00 N, 57 00 E",Middle East,"309,500 sq km","309,500 sq km",0 sq km,twice the size of Georgia;

In 2016, low global oil prices drove Omanâ€™s budget deficit to $13.8 billion, or approximately 20% of GDP, but the budget deficit is estimated to have reduced to 12% of GDP in 2017 as Oman reduced government subsidies. As of January 2018, Oman has sufficient foreign assets to support its currencyâ€™s fixed exchange rates. It is issuing debt to cover its deficit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oman is using enhanced oil recovery techniques to boost production, but it has simultaneously pursued a development plan that focuses on diversification, industrialization, and privatization, with the objective of reducing the oil sector&#39;s contribution to GDP. The key components of the government&#39;s diversification strategy are tourism, shipping and logistics, mining, manufacturing, and aquaculture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muscat also has notably focused on creating more Omani jobs to employ the rising number of nationals entering the workforce. However, high social welfare benefits - that had increased in the wake of the 2011 Arab Spring - have made it impossible for the government to balance its budget in light of current oil prices. In response, Omani officials imposed austerity measures on its gasoline and diesel subsidies in 2016. These spending cuts have had only a moderate effect on the governmentâ€™s budget, which is projected to again face a deficit of $7.8 billion in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;",$190.1 billion,$70.78 billion (2017 est.),-0.90%,"$46,000 ",16.1% of GDP,36.8% (2017 est.),26.2% (2017 est.),27.8% (2017 est.),3% (2017 est.),51.5% (2017 est.),-46.6% (2017 est.),1.8% (2017 est.),46.4% (2017 est.),51.8% (2017 est.),"dates, limes, bananas, alfalfa, vegetables;

MDV,Maldives,MV,23-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;A sultanate since the 12th century, the Maldives became a British protectorate in 1887. The islands became a republic in 1968, three years after independence. President Maumoon Abdul GAYOOM dominated Maldives&#39; political scene for 30 years, elected to six successive terms by single-party referendums. Following political demonstrations in the capital Male in August 2003, GAYOOM and his government pledged to embark upon a process of liberalization and democratic reforms, including a more representative political system and expanded political freedoms. Political parties were legalized in 2005.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In June 2008, a constituent assembly - termed the &quot;Special Majlis&quot; - finalized a new constitution ratified by GAYOOM in August 2008. The first-ever presidential elections under a multi-candidate, multi-party system were held in October 2008. GAYOOM was defeated in a runoff poll by Mohamed NASHEED, a political activist who had been jailed several years earlier by the GAYOOM regime. In early February 2012, after several weeks of street protests in response to his ordering the arrest of a top judge, NASHEED purportedly resigned the presidency and handed over power to Vice President Mohammed WAHEED Hassan Maniku. A government-appointed Commission of National Inquiry concluded there was no evidence of a coup, but NASHEED contends that police and military personnel forced him to resign. NASHEED, WAHEED, and Abdulla YAMEEN Abdul Gayoom ran in the 2013 elections with YAMEEN ultimately winning the presidency after three rounds of voting. As president, YAMEEN weakened democratic institutions, curtailed civil liberties, jailed his political opponents, restricted the press, and exerted control over the judiciary to strengthen his hold on power and limit dissent. In September 2018, YAMEEN lost his reelection bid to Ibrahim Mohamed SOLIH, a parliamentarian of the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), who had the support of a coalition of four parties that came together to defeat YAMEEN and restore democratic norms to Maldives. In April 2019, SOLIH&#39;s MDP won 65 of 87 seats in parliament.&lt;/p&gt;","Southern Asia, group of atolls in the Indian Ocean, south-southwest of India","3 15 N, 73 00 E",Asia,298 sq km,298 sq km,0 sq km,"about 1.7 times the size of Washington, DC",,,644 km,12 nm,200 nm,24 nm,,"tropical;

MEX,Mexico,MX,18-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;The site of several advanced Amerindian civilizations - including the Olmec, Toltec, Teotihuacan, Zapotec, Maya, and Aztec - Mexico was conquered and colonized by Spain in the early 16th century. Administered as the Viceroyalty of New Spain for three centuries, it achieved independence early in the 19th century. Elections held in 2000 marked the first time since the 1910 Mexican Revolution that an opposition candidate - Vicente FOX of the National Action Party (PAN) - defeated the party in government, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). He was succeeded in 2006 by another PAN candidate Felipe CALDERON, but Enrique PENA NIETO regained the presidency for the PRI in 2012. Left-leaning antiestablishment politician and former mayor of Mexico City (2000-05) Andres Manuel LOPEZ OBRADOR, from the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), became president in December 2018.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The global financial crisis in late 2008 caused a massive economic downturn in Mexico the following year, although growth returned quickly in 2010. Ongoing economic and social concerns include low real wages, high underemployment, inequitable income distribution, and few advancement opportunities for the largely indigenous population in the impoverished southern states. Since 2007, Mexico&#39;s powerful drug-trafficking organizations have engaged in bloody feuding, resulting in tens of thousands of drug-related homicides.&lt;/p&gt;","North America, bordering the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, between Belize and the United States and bordering the North Pacific Ocean, between Guatemala and the United States","23 00 N, 102 00 W",North America,"1,964,375 sq km","1,943,945 sq km","20,430 sq km",slightly less than three times the size of Texas,"4,389 km","Belize 276 km, Guatemala 958 km, US 3155 km","9,330 km",12 nm,200 nm,24 nm,200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin,varies from tropical to desert,"high, rugged mountains;

In 2012, Mexico formed the Pacific Alliance with Peru, Colombia, and Chile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico&#39;s current government, led by President Enrique PENA NIETO, has emphasized economic reforms, passing and implementing sweeping energy, financial, fiscal, and telecommunications reform legislation, among others, with the long-term aim to improve competitiveness and economic growth across the Mexican economy. Since 2015, Mexico has held public auctions of oil and gas exploration and development rights and for long-term electric power generation contracts. Mexico has also issued permits for private sector import, distribution, and retail sales of refined petroleum products in an effort to attract private investment into the energy sector and boost production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2013, Mexicoâ€™s economic growth has averaged 2% annually, falling short of private-sector expectations that President PENA NIETOâ€™s sweeping reforms would bolster economic prospects. Growth is predicted to remain below potential given falling oil production, weak oil prices, structural issues such as low productivity, high inequality, a large informal sector employing over half of the workforce, weak rule of law, and corruption. Mexicoâ€™s economy remains vulnerable to uncertainty surrounding the future of NAFTA â€” because the United States is its top trading partner and the two countries share integrated supply chains â€” and to potential shifts in domestic policies following the inauguration of a new a president in December 2018.&lt;/p&gt;",$2.463 trillion,$1.151 trillion (2017 est.),2%,"$19,900 ",21.4% of GDP,67% (2017 est.),11.8% (2017 est.),22.3% (2017 est.),0.8% (2017 est.),37.8% (2017 est.),-39.7% (2017 est.),3.6% (2017 est.),31.9% (2017 est.),64.5% (2017 est.),"corn, wheat, soybeans, rice, beans, cotton, coffee, fruit, tomatoes;

MYS,Malaysia,MY,23-Dec-19,"During the late 18th and 19th centuries, Great Britain established colonies and protectorates in the area of current Malaysia; these were occupied by Japan from 1942 to 1945. In 1948, the British-ruled territories on the Malay Peninsula except Singapore formed the Federation of Malaya, which became independent in 1957. Malaysia was formed in 1963 when the former British colonies of Singapore, as well as Sabah and Sarawak on the northern coast of Borneo, joined the Federation. The first several years of the country&#39;s independence were marred by a communist insurgency, Indonesian confrontation with Malaysia, Philippine claims to Sabah, and Singapore&#39;s withdrawal in 1965. During the 22-year term of Prime Minister MAHATHIR Mohamad (1981-2003), Malaysia was successful in diversifying its economy from dependence on exports of raw materials to the development of manufacturing, services, and tourism. Prime Minister MAHATHIR and a newly-formed coalition of opposition parties defeated Prime Minister Mohamed NAJIB bin Abdul Razak&#39;s United Malays National Organization (UMNO) in May 2018, ending over 60 years of uninterrupted rule by UMNO.","Southeastern Asia, peninsula bordering Thailand and northern one-third of the island of Borneo, bordering Indonesia, Brunei, and the South China Sea, south of Vietnam","2 30 N, 112 30 E",Southeast Asia,"329,847 sq km","328,657 sq km","1,190 sq km",slightly larger than New Mexico,"2,742 km","Brunei 266 km, Indonesia 1881 km, Thailand 595 km","4,675 km (Peninsular Malaysia 2,068 km, East Malaysia 2,607 km)",12 nm,200 nm,, 200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation;

Under current Prime Minister NAJIB, Malaysia is attempting to achieve high-income status by 2020 and to move further up the value-added production chain by attracting investments in high technology, knowledge-based industries and services. NAJIB&#39;s Economic Transformation Program is a series of projects and policy measures intended to accelerate the country&#39;s economic growth. The government has also taken steps to liberalize some services sub-sectors. Malaysia is vulnerable to a fall in world commodity prices or a general slowdown in global economic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NAJIB administration is continuing efforts to boost domestic demand and reduce the economy&#39;s dependence on exports. Domestic demand continues to anchor economic growth, supported mainly by private consumption, which accounts for 53% of GDP. Nevertheless, exports - particularly of electronics, oil and gas, and palm oil - remain a significant driver of the economy. In 2015, gross exports of goods and services were equivalent to 73% of GDP. The oil and gas sector supplied about 22% of government revenue in 2015, down significantly from prior years amid a decline in commodity prices and diversification of government revenues. Malaysia has embarked on a fiscal reform program aimed at achieving a balanced budget by 2020, including rationalization of subsidies and the 2015 introduction of a 6% value added tax. Sustained low commodity prices throughout the period not only strained government finances, but also shrunk Malaysiaâ€™s current account surplus and weighed heavily on the Malaysian ringgit, which was among the regionâ€™s worst performing currencies during 2013-17. The ringgit hit new lows following the US presidential election amid a broader selloff of emerging market assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank Negara Malaysia (the central bank) maintains adequate foreign exchange reserves; a well-developed regulatory regime has limited Malaysia&#39;s exposure to riskier financial instruments, although it remains vulnerable to volatile global capital flows. In order to increase Malaysiaâ€™s competitiveness, Prime Minister NAJIB raised possible revisions to the special economic and social preferences accorded to ethnic Malays under the New Economic Policy of 1970, but retreated in 2013 after he encountered significant opposition from Malay nationalists and other vested interests. In September 2013 NAJIB launched the new Bumiputra Economic Empowerment Program, policies that favor and advance the economic condition of ethnic Malays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malaysia signed the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement in February 2016, although the future of the TPP remains unclear following the US withdrawal from the agreement.

MOZ,Mozambique,MZ,31-Dec-19,"Almost five centuries as a Portuguese colony came to a close with independence in 1975. Large-scale emigration, economic dependence on South Africa, a severe drought, and a prolonged civil war hindered the country&#39;s development until the mid-1990s. The ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO) party formally abandoned Marxism in 1989, and a new constitution the following year provided for multiparty elections and a free market economy. A UN-negotiated peace agreement between FRELIMO and rebel Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO) forces ended the fighting in 1992. In 2004, Mozambique underwent a delicate transition as Joaquim CHISSANO stepped down after 18 years in office. His elected successor, Armando GUEBUZA, served two terms and then passed executive power to Filipe NYUSI in 2015. RENAMO&amp;rsquo;s residual armed forces have intermittently engaged in a low-level insurgency since 2012, although a late December 2016 ceasefire held throughout 2018 and has facilitated efforts toward a peacebuilding initiative and a constitutional amendment to devolve some governance to the provinces. Since October 2017, the northern province of Cabo Delgado has experienced violent extremist attacks.","Southeastern Africa, bordering the Mozambique Channel, between South Africa and Tanzania","18 15 S, 35 00 E",Africa,"799,380 sq km","786,380 sq km","13,000 sq km",slightly more than five times the size of Georgia;

MANHICA/unknown,"&lt;p&gt;At independence in 1975, Mozambique was one of the world&#39;s poorest countries. Socialist policies, economic mismanagement, and a brutal civil war from 1977 to 1992 further impoverished the country. In 1987, the government embarked on a series of macroeconomic reforms designed to stabilize the economy. These steps, combined with donor assistance and with political stability since the multi-party elections in 1994, propelled the countryâ€™s GDP, in purchasing power parity terms, from $4 billion in 1993 to about $37 billion in 2017. Fiscal reforms, including the introduction of a value-added tax and reform of the customs service, have improved the government&#39;s revenue collection abilities. In spite of these gains, about half the population remains below the poverty line and subsistence agriculture continues to employ the vast majority of the country&#39;s work force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mozambique&#39;s once substantial foreign debt was reduced through forgiveness and rescheduling under the IMF&#39;s Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and Enhanced HIPC initiatives. However, in 2016, information surfaced revealing that the Mozambican Government was responsible for over $2 billion in government-backed loans secured between 2012-14 by state-owned defense and security companies without parliamentary approval or national budget inclusion; this prompted the IMF and international donors to halt direct budget support to the Government of Mozambique. An international audit was performed on Mozambiqueâ€™s debt in 2016-17, but debt restructuring and resumption of donor support have yet to occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mozambique grew at an average annual rate of 6%-8% in the decade leading up to 2015, one of Africa&#39;s strongest performances, but the sizable external debt burden, donor withdrawal, elevated inflation, and currency depreciation contributed to slower growth in 2016-17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two major International consortiums, led by American companies ExxonMobil and Anadarko, are seeking approval to develop massive natural gas deposits off the coast of Cabo Delgado province, in what has the potential to become the largest infrastructure project in Africa. .

The high population growth rate is somewhat restrained by the countryâ€™s high HIV/AIDS and overall mortality rates. Mozambique ranks among the worst in the world for HIV/AIDS prevalence, HIV/AIDS deaths, and life expectancy at birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mozambique is predominantly a country of emigration, but internal, rural-urban migration has begun to grow. Mozambicans, primarily from the countryâ€™s southern region, have been migrating to South Africa for work for more than a century. Additionally, approximately 1.7 million Mozambicans fled to Malawi, South Africa, and other neighboring countries between 1979 and 1992 to escape from civil war. Labor migrants have usually been men from rural areas whose crops have failed or who are unemployed and have headed to South Africa to work as miners; multiple generations of the same family often become miners. Since the abolition of apartheid in South Africa in 1991, other job opportunities have opened to Mozambicans, including in the informal and manufacturing sectors, but mining remains their main source of employment.&lt;/p&gt;","4,787 km (2014)",,"4,787 km 1.067-m gauge (2014)",,,,,,,,,,,schistosomiasis (2016),rabies (2016),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NGA,Niger,NG,18-Dec-19,"Niger became independent from France in 1960 and experienced single-party and military rule until 1991, when Gen. Ali SAIBOU was forced by public pressure to allow multiparty elections, which resulted in a democratic government in 1993. Political infighting brought the government to a standstill and in 1996 led to a coup by Col. Ibrahim BARE. In 1999, BARE was killed in a counter coup by military officers who restored democratic rule and held elections that brought Mamadou TANDJA to power in December of that year. TANDJA was reelected in 2004 and in 2009 spearheaded a constitutional amendment allowing him to extend his term as president. In February 2010, military officers led a coup that deposed TANDJA and suspended the constitution. ISSOUFOU Mahamadou was elected in April 2011 following the coup and reelected to a second term in early 2016. Niger is one of the poorest countries in the world with minimal government services and insufficient funds to develop its resource base, and is ranked last in the world on the United Nations Development Programme&amp;rsquo;s Human Development Index. The largely agrarian and subsistence-based economy is frequently disrupted by extended droughts common to the Sahel region of Africa. The Nigerien Government continues its attempts to diversify the economy through increased oil production and mining projects. A Tuareg rebellion emerged in 2007 and ended in 2009. Niger is facing increased security concerns on its borders from various external threats including insecurity in Libya, spillover from the conflict in Mali, and violent extremism in northeastern Nigeria.","Western Africa, southeast of Algeria","16 00 N, 8 00 E",Africa,1.267 million sq km,"1,266,700 sq km",300 sq km,slightly less than twice the size of Texas,"5,834 km","Algeria 951 km, Benin 277 km, Burkina Faso 622 km, Chad 1196 km, Libya 342 km, Mali 838 km, Nigeria 1608 km",0 km (landlocked),,,,,"desert;

Agriculture contributes approximately 40% of GDP and provides livelihood for over 80% of the population. The UN ranked Niger as the second least developed country in the world in 2016 due to multiple factors such as food insecurity, lack of industry, high population growth, a weak educational sector, and few prospects for work outside of subsistence farming and herding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2011 public debt has increased due to efforts to scale-up public investment, particularly that related to infrastructure, as well as due to increased security spending. The government relies on foreign donor resources for a large portion of its fiscal budget. The economy in recent years has been hurt by terrorist activity near its uranium mines and by instability in Mali and in the Diffa region of the country; concerns about security have resulted in increased support from regional and international partners on defense. Low uranium prices, demographics, and security expenditures may continue to put pressure on the governmentâ€™s finances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government of Niger plans to exploit oil, gold, coal, and other mineral resources to sustain future growth. Although Niger has sizable reserves of oil, the prolonged drop in oil prices has reduced profitability. Food insecurity and drought remain perennial problems for Niger, and the government plans to invest more in irrigation. Nigerâ€™s three-year $131 million IMF Extended Credit Facility (ECF) agreement for the years 2012-15 was extended until the end of 2016. In February 2017, the IMF approved a new 3-year $134 million ECF. In June 2017, The World Bankâ€™s International Development Association (IDA) granted Niger $1 billion over three years for IDA18, a program to boost the countryâ€™s development and alleviate poverty. A $437 million Millennium Challenge Account compact for Niger, commencing in FY18, will focus on large-scale irrigation infrastructure development and community-based, climate-resilient agriculture, while promoting sustainable increases in agricultural productivity and sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formal private sector investment needed for economic diversification and growth remains a challenge, given the countryâ€™s limited domestic markets, access to credit, and competitiveness. Although President ISSOUFOU is courting foreign investors, including those from the US, as of April 2017, there were no US firms operating in Niger.

A slight decline in fertility over the last few decades has stalled. This leveling off of the high fertility rate is in large part a product of the continued desire for large families. In Niger, the TFR is lower than the desired fertility rate, which makes it unlikely that contraceptive use will increase. The high TFR sustains rapid population growth and a large youth population â€“ almost 70% of the populace is under the age of 25. Gender inequality, including a lack of educational opportunities for women and early marriage and childbirth, also contributes to high population growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of large family sizes, children are inheriting smaller and smaller parcels of land. The dependence of most Nigeriens on subsistence farming on increasingly small landholdings, coupled with declining rainfall and the resultant shrinkage of arable land, are all preventing food production from keeping up with population growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more than half a century, Niger&#39;s lack of economic development has led to steady net outmigration. In the 1960s, Nigeriens mainly migrated to coastal West African countries to work on a seasonal basis. Some headed to Libya and Algeria in the 1970s to work in the booming oil industry until its decline in the 1980s. Since the 1990s, the principal destinations for Nigerien labor migrants have been West African countries, especially Burkina Faso and Cote dâ€™Ivoire, while emigration to Europe and North America has remained modest. During the same period, Nigerâ€™s desert trade route town Agadez became a hub for West African and other sub-Saharan migrants crossing the Sahara to North Africa and sometimes onward to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 60,000 Malian refugees have fled to Niger since violence between Malian government troops and armed rebels began in early 2012. Ongoing attacks by the Boko Haram Islamist insurgency, dating to 2013 in northern Nigeria and February 2015 in southeastern Niger, have pushed tens of thousands of Nigerian refugees and Nigerien returnees across the border to Niger and to displace thousands of locals in Nigerâ€™s already impoverished Diffa region.&lt;/p&gt;",,,,,,,,,,,none (landlocked),,,schistosomiasis (2016),rabies (2016),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,meningococcal meningitis (2016),,,,,,,,"&lt;strong&gt;aim(s):&lt;/strong&gt; establish an Islamic caliphate across Africa&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;area(s) of operation:&lt;/strong&gt; conducts kidnappings, bombings, and assaults; responsible for displacing thousands of people and contributing to food insecurity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;note:&lt;/strong&gt; violently opposes any political or social activity associated with Western society, including voting, attending secular schools, and wearing Western dress (2018)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,&lt;strong&gt;aim(s): &lt;/strong&gt;replace regional governments with an Islamic state&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;area(s) of operation:&lt;/strong&gt; mostly concentrated along the Mali-Niger border region; targets primarily security forces (2018),,,"&lt;strong&gt;aim(s): &lt;/strong&gt;implement ISIS&#39;s strict interpretation of Sharia; replace the Nigerian Government with an Islamic state&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;area(s) of operation:&lt;/strong&gt; based primarily in the southeast along the border with Nigeria, with its largest presence in northeast Nigeria and the Lake Chad region; targets primarily regional military installations, especially in the southeastern Diffa region (2018)","&lt;strong&gt;aim(s): &lt;/strong&gt;replace several African governments, including Niger&#39;s government, with an Islamic state&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;area(s) of operation: &lt;/strong&gt;conducts attacks against Nigerien military and security personnel; targets Westerners for kidnappings for ransom&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (2018)","&lt;strong&gt;aim(s): &lt;/strong&gt;establish an Islamic state centered in Mali&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;area(s) of operation:&lt;/strong&gt; primarily based in northern and central Mali; targets Western and local interests in West Africa and Sahel; has claimed responsibility for attacks in Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;note:&lt;/strong&gt; pledged allegiance to al-Qa&#39;ida and AQIM; holds Western hostages; wages attacks against security and peacekeeping forces in Mali (2018)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NIC,Nigeria,NI,26-Dec-19,"British influence and control over what would become Nigeria and Africa&#39;s most populous country grew through the 19th century. A series of constitutions after World War II granted Nigeria greater autonomy. After independence in 1960, politics were marked by coups and mostly military rule, until the death of a military head of state in 1998 allowed for a political transition. In 1999, a new constitution was adopted and a peaceful transition to civilian government was completed. The government continues to face the daunting task of institutionalizing democracy and reforming a petroleum-based economy, whose revenues have been squandered through corruption and mismanagement. In addition, Nigeria continues to experience longstanding ethnic and religious tensions. Although both the 2003 and 2007 presidential elections were marred by significant irregularities and violence, Nigeria is currently experiencing its longest period of civilian rule since independence. The general elections of 2007 marked the first civilian-to-civilian transfer of power in the country&#39;s history and the elections of 2011 were generally regarded as credible. The 2015 election was heralded for the fact that the then-umbrella opposition party, the All Progressives Congress, defeated the long-ruling People&#39;s Democratic Party that had governed since 1999 and assumed the presidency after a peaceful transfer of power. Successful presidential and legislative elections were held in early 2019.","Western Africa, bordering the Gulf of Guinea, between Benin and Cameroon","10 00 N, 8 00 E",Africa,"923,768 sq km","910,768 sq km","13,000 sq km",about six times the size of Georgia;

Following the 2008-09 global financial crises, the banking sector was effectively recapitalized and regulation enhanced. Since then, Nigeriaâ€™s economic growth has been driven by growth in agriculture, telecommunications, and services. Economic diversification and strong growth have not translated into a significant decline in poverty levels; over 62% of Nigeria&#39;s over 180 million people still live in extreme poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its strong fundamentals, oil-rich Nigeria has been hobbled by inadequate power supply, lack of infrastructure, delays in the passage of legislative reforms, an inefficient property registration system, restrictive trade policies, an inconsistent regulatory environment, a slow and ineffective judicial system, unreliable dispute resolution mechanisms, insecurity, and pervasive corruption. Regulatory constraints and security risks have limited new investment in oil and natural gas, and Nigeria&#39;s oil production had been contracting every year since 2012 until a slight rebound in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President BUHARI, elected in March 2015, has established a cabinet of economic ministers that includes several technocrats, and he has announced plans to increase transparency, diversify the economy away from oil, and improve fiscal management, but has taken a primarily protectionist approach that favors domestic producers at the expense of consumers. President BUHARI ran on an anti-corruption platform, and has made some headway in alleviating corruption, such as implementation of a Treasury Single Account that allows the government to better manage its resources and a more transparent government payroll and personnel system that eliminated duplicate and &quot;ghost workers.&quot; The government also is working to develop stronger public-private partnerships for roads, agriculture, and power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nigeria entered recession in 2016 as a result of lower oil prices and production, exacerbated by militant attacks on oil and gas infrastructure in the Niger Delta region, coupled with detrimental economic policies, including foreign exchange restrictions.

NLD,Netherlands,NL,29-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;The Dutch United Provinces declared their independence from Spain in 1579; during the 17th century, they became a leading seafaring and commercial power, with settlements and colonies around the world. After a 20-year French occupation, a Kingdom of the Netherlands was formed in 1815. In 1830, Belgium seceded and formed a separate kingdom. The Netherlands remained neutral in World War I, but suffered German invasion and occupation in World War II. A modern, industrialized nation, the Netherlands is also a large exporter of agricultural products. The country was a founding member of NATO and the EEC (now the EU) and participated in the introduction of the euro in 1999. In October 2010, the former Netherlands Antilles was dissolved and the three smallest islands - Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba - became special municipalities in the Netherlands administrative structure. The larger islands of Sint Maarten and Curacao joined the Netherlands and Aruba as constituent countries forming the Kingdom of the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In February 2018, the Sint Eustatius island council (governing body) was dissolved and replaced by a government commissioner to restore the integrity of public administration.

NOR,Norway,NO,29-Dec-19,"Two centuries of Viking raids into Europe tapered off following the adoption of Christianity by King Olav TRYGGVASON in 994; conversion of the Norwegian kingdom occurred over the next several decades. In 1397, Norway was absorbed into a union with Denmark that lasted more than four centuries. In 1814, Norwegians resisted the cession of their country to Sweden and adopted a new constitution. Sweden then invaded Norway but agreed to let Norway keep its constitution in return for accepting the union under a Swedish king. Rising nationalism throughout the 19th century led to a 1905 referendum granting Norway independence. Although Norway remained neutral in World War I, it suffered heavy losses to its shipping. Norway proclaimed its neutrality at the outset of World War II, but was nonetheless occupied for five years by Nazi Germany (1940-45). In 1949, Norway abandoned neutrality and became a member of NATO. Discovery of oil and gas in adjacent waters in the late 1960s boosted Norway&#39;s economic fortunes. In referenda held in 1972 and 1994, Norway rejected joining the EU. Key domestic issues include immigration and integration of ethnic minorities, maintaining the country&#39;s extensive social safety net with an aging population, and preserving economic competitiveness.","Northern Europe, bordering the North Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, west of Sweden","62 00 N, 10 00 E",Europe,"323,802 sq km","304,282 sq km","19,520 sq km",slightly larger than twice the size of Georgia;

Norway opted out of the EU during a referendum in November 1994. However, as a member of the European Economic Area, Norway partially participates in the EUâ€™s single market and contributes sizably to the EU budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country is richly endowed with natural resources such as oil and gas, fish, forests, and minerals. Norway is a leading producer and the worldâ€™s second largest exporter of seafood, after China. The government manages the countryâ€™s petroleum resources through extensive regulation. The petroleum sector provides about 9% of jobs, 12% of GDP, 13% of the stateâ€™s revenue, and 37% of exports, according to official national estimates. Norway is one of the world&#39;s leading petroleum exporters, although oil production is close to 50% below its peak in 2000. Gas production, conversely, has more than doubled since 2000. Although oil production is historically low, it rose in 2016 for the third consecutive year due to the higher production of existing oil fields and to new fields coming on stream. Norwayâ€™s domestic electricity production relies almost entirely on hydropower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In anticipation of eventual declines in oil and gas production, Norway saves state revenue from petroleum sector activities in the world&#39;s largest sovereign wealth fund, valued at over $1 trillion at the end of 2017. To help balance the federal budget each year, the government follows a &quot;fiscal rule,&quot; which states that spending of revenues from petroleum and fund investments shall correspond to the expected real rate of return on the fund, an amount it estimates is sustainable over time. In February 2017, the government revised the expected rate of return for the fund downward from 4% to 3%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After solid GDP growth in the 2004-07 period, the economy slowed in 2008, and contracted in 2009, before returning to modest, positive growth from 2010 to 2017. The Norwegian economy has been adjusting to lower energy prices, as demonstrated by growth in labor force participation and employment in 2017. GDP growth was about 1.5% in 2017, driven largely by domestic demand, which has been boosted by the rebound in the labor market and supportive fiscal policies. Economic growth is expected to remain constant or improve slightly in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;",$381.2 billion,$398.8 billion (2017 est.),1.90%,"$72,100 ",34.3% of GDP,44.8% (2017 est.),24% (2017 est.),24.1% (2017 est.),4.8% (2017 est.),35.5% (2017 est.),-33.2% (2017 est.),2.3% (2017 est.),33.7% (2017 est.),64% (2017 est.),"barley, wheat, potatoes; pork, beef, veal, milk; fish","petroleum and gas, shipping, fishing, aquaculture, food processing, shipbuilding, pulp and paper products, metals, chemicals, timber, mining, textiles",1.5% (2017 est.),2.797 million (2017 est.),2.10%,19.30%,78.6% (2016 est.),4.20%, NA,3.80%,21.2% (2014),217.1 billion (2017 est.),199.5 billion (2017 est.),54.4% (of GDP) (2017 est.),4.4% (of GDP) (2017 est.),36.5% of GDP,calendar year,1.90%,1.75%,2.96%,$214 billion,$214 billion,$571.4 billion,$265.4 billion,$22.01 billion,$102.8 billion,"UK 21.1%, Germany 15.5%, Netherlands 9.9%, Sweden 6.6%, France 6.4%, Belgium 4.8%, Denmark 4.7%, US 4.6% (2017)","petroleum and petroleum products, machinery and equipment, metals, chemicals, ships, fish",$95.06 billion,"machinery and equipment, chemicals, metals, foodstuffs","Sweden 11.4%, Germany 11%, China 9.8%, US 6.8%, South Korea 6.7%, Denmark 5.4%, UK 4.7% (2017)",$57.46 billion,$640.1 billion,$219.1 billion,$191.7 billion,Norwegian kroner (NOK) per US dollar -,100% (2016),147.7 billion kWh (2016 est.),122.2 billion kWh (2016 est.),15.53 billion kWh (2016 est.),5.741 billion kWh (2016 est.),33.86 million kW (2016 est.),3% of total installed capacity (2016 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),93% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),4% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),1.517 million bbl/day (2018 est.),1.383 million bbl/day (2017 est.),"36,550 bbl/day (2017 est.)",6.376 billion bbl (1 January 2018),"371,600 bbl/day (2017 est.)","205,300 bbl/day (2017 est.)","432,800 bbl/day (2017 est.)","135,300 bbl/day (2017 est.)",123.9 billion cu m (2017 est.),4.049 billion cu m (2017 est.),120.2 billion cu m (2017 est.),5.663 million cu m (2017 est.),1.782 trillion cu m (1 January 2018 est.),39.8 million Mt (2017 est.),"745,182",14 (2017 est.),"5,721,255",108 (2017 est.),modern in all respects; one of the most advanced telecommunications networks in Europe;&amp;nbsp;forward leaning in LTE-A developments; looking to close 3G and 2G networks by&amp;nbsp;2025 and preparing for 5G; broadband penetration rate is among the best in Europe (2018),Norway has a domestic satellite system; the prevalence of rural areas encourages the wide use of mobile-cellular systems; fixed-line 14 per 100 and mobile-cellular 108 per 100 (2018),"country code - 47;&amp;nbsp;landing points for the&amp;nbsp;Svalbard Undersea Cable System, Polar Circle Cable, Bodo-Rost Cable, NOR5KE Viking, Celtic Norse, Tempnet Offshore FOC Network, England Cable, Denmark-Norwary6, Havfrue/AEC-2, Skagerrak 4, and the Skagenfiber West &amp;amp; East&amp;nbsp;submarine cables providing links to other Nordic countries, Europe and the US; satellite earth stations - NA Eutelsat, NA Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean), and 1 Inmarsat (Atlantic and Indian Ocean regions); note - Norway shares the Inmarsat earth station with the other Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, and Sweden) (2019)","state-owned public radio-TV broadcaster operates 3 nationwide TV stations, 3 nationwide radio stations, and 16 regional radio stations; roughly a dozen privately owned TV stations broadcast nationally and roughly another 25 local TV stations broadcasting; nearly 75% of households have access to multi-channel cable or satellite TV; 2 privately owned radio stations broadcast nationwide and another 240 stations operate locally; Norway is the first country in the world to phase out FM radio in favor of Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB), a process scheduled for completion in late 2017 (2019)",.no,"5,122,904",97.3% (July 2016 est.),"2,134,105",40 (2017 est.),1.8% of GDP,"Norwegian Armed Forces:&amp;nbsp; Norwegian Army (Haeren), Royal Norwegian Navy (Kongelige Norske Sjoeforsvaret; includes Coastal Rangers and Coast Guard (Kystvakt)), Royal Norwegian Air Force (Kongelige Norske Luftforsvaret), Home Guard (Heimevernet, HV) (2019)","19-35 years of age for male and female selective compulsory military service; 17 years of age for male volunteers (16 in wartime); 18 years of age for women; 19-month service obligation; conscripts first serve 12 months from 19-28, and then up to 4-5 refresher training periods until age 35, 44, 55, or 60 depending on rank and function.

NPL,Nepal,NP,29-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;During the late 18th-early 19th centuries, the principality of Gorkha united many of the other principalities and states of the sub-Himalayan region into a Nepali Kingdom. Nepal retained its independence following the Anglo-Nepalese War of 1814-16 and the subsequent peace treaty laid the foundations for two centuries of amicable relations between Britain and Nepal. (The Brigade of Gurkhas continues to serve in the British Army to the present day.) In 1951, the Nepali monarch ended the century-old system of rule by hereditary premiers and instituted a cabinet system that brought political parties into the government. That arrangement lasted until 1960, when political parties were again banned, but was reinstated in 1990 with the establishment of a multiparty democracy within the framework of a constitutional monarchy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An insurgency led by Maoists broke out in 1996. During the ensuing 10-year civil war between Maoist and government forces, the monarchy dissolved the cabinet and parliament and re-assumed absolute power in 2002, after the crown prince massacred the royal family in 2001. A peace accord in 2006 led to the promulgation of an interim constitution in 2007. Following a nationwide Constituent Assembly (CA) election in 2008, the newly formed CA declared Nepal a federal democratic republic, abolished the monarchy, and elected the country&#39;s first president. After the CA failed to draft a constitution by a 2012 deadline set by the Supreme Court, then-Prime Minister Baburam BHATTARAI dissolved the CA. Months of negotiations ensued until 2013 when the major political parties agreed to create an interim government headed by then-Chief Justice Khil Raj REGMI with a mandate to hold elections for a new CA. Elections were held in 2013, in which the Nepali Congress (NC) won the largest share of seats in the CA and in 2014 formed a coalition government with the second-place Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist-Leninist (UML) with NC President Sushil KOIRALA serving as prime minister. Nepal&#39;s new constitution came into effect in 2015, at which point the CA became the Parliament. Khagda Prasad Sharma OLI served as the first post-constitution prime minister from 2015 to 2016. OLI resigned ahead of a no-confidence motion against him, and Parliament elected Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist (CPN-M) leader Pushpa Kamal DAHAL (aka &quot;Prachanda&quot;) prime minister. The constitution provided for a transitional period during which three sets of elections &amp;ndash; local, provincial, and national &amp;ndash; needed to take place. The first local elections in 20 years occurred in three phases between May and September 2017, and state and federal elections proceeded in two phases in November and December 2017. The parties headed by OLI and DAHAL ran in coalition and swept the parliamentary elections, and OLI, who led the larger of the two parties, was sworn in as prime minister in February 2018. In May 2018, OLI and DAHAL announced the merger of their parties - the UML and CPN-M - to establish the Nepal Communist Party (NCP), which is now the ruling party in Parliament.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;","Southern Asia, between China and India","28 00 N, 84 00 E",Asia,"147,181 sq km","143,351 sq km","3,830 sq km",slightly larger than New York state,"3,159 km","China 1389 km, India 1770 km",0 km (landlocked),,,,,varies from cool summers and severe winters in north to subtropical summers and mild winters in south,Tarai or flat river plain of the Ganges in south;

Nepal is heavily dependent on remittances, which amount to as much as 30% of GDP. Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, providing a livelihood for almost two-thirds of the population but accounting for less than a third of GDP. Industrial activity mainly involves the processing of agricultural products, including pulses, jute, sugarcane, tobacco, and grain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nepal has considerable scope for exploiting its potential in hydropower, with an estimated 42,000 MW of commercially feasible capacity. Nepal has signed trade and investment agreements with India, China, and other countries, but political uncertainty and a difficult business climate have hampered foreign investment.

Although political gridlock and lack of capacity have hindered post-earthquake recovery, government-led reconstruction efforts have progressively picked up speed, although many hard hit areas still have seen little assistance.

In 1840, their chieftains entered into a compact with Great Britain, the Treaty of Waitangi, in which they ceded sovereignty to Queen Victoria while retaining territorial rights. That same year, the British began the first organized colonial settlement. A series of land wars between 1843 and 1872 ended with the defeat of the native peoples. The British colony of New Zealand became an independent dominion in 1907 and supported the UK militarily in both world wars.

This dynamic growth has boosted real incomes, but left behind some at the bottom of the ladder and broadened and deepened the technological capabilities of the industrial sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per capita income rose for 10 consecutive years until 2007 in purchasing power parity terms, but fell in 2008-09. Debt-driven consumer spending drove robust growth in the first half of the decade, fueling a large balance of payments deficit that posed a challenge for policymakers. Inflationary pressures caused the central bank to raise its key rate steadily from January 2004 until it was among the highest in the OECD in 2007 and 2008. The higher rate attracted international capital inflows, which strengthened the currency and housing market while aggravating the current account deficit. Rising house prices, especially in Auckland, have become a political issue in recent years, as well as a policy challenge in 2016 and 2017, as the ability to afford housing has declined for many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expanding New Zealandâ€™s network of free trade agreements remains a top foreign policy priority.

A large percentage of the population, especially in rural areas, derives its living from agricultural activity, often on a subsistence basis. Because of the importance of the informal sector, accurate economic measures are difficult to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a per capita basis, real income has grown steadily over the past five years as strong world demand for commodities, combined with high prices and favorable weather, supported Paraguay&#39;s commodity-based export expansion. Paraguay is the fifth largest soy producer in the world. Drought hit in 2008, reducing agricultural exports and slowing the economy even before the onset of the global recession. The economy fell 3.8% in 2009, as lower world demand and commodity prices caused exports to contract. Severe drought and outbreaks of hoof-and-mouth disease in 2012 led to a brief drop in beef and other agricultural exports. Since 2014, however, Paraguayâ€™s economy has grown at a 4% average annual rate due to strong production and high global prices, at a time when other countries in the region have contracted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Paraguayan Government recognizes the need to diversify its economy and has taken steps in recent years to do so. In addition to looking for new commodity markets in the Middle East and Europe, Paraguayan officials have promoted the countryâ€™s low labor costs, cheap energy from its massive Itaipu Hydroelectric Dam, and single-digit tax rate on foreign firms.

PER,Peru,PE,19-Dec-19,"Ancient Peru was the seat of several prominent Andean civilizations, most notably that of the Incas whose empire was captured by Spanish conquistadors in 1533. Peru declared its independence in 1821, and remaining Spanish forces were defeated in 1824. After a dozen years of military rule, Peru returned to democratic leadership in 1980, but experienced economic problems and the growth of a violent insurgency. President Alberto FUJIMORI&#39;s election in 1990 ushered in a decade that saw a dramatic turnaround in the economy and significant progress in curtailing guerrilla activity. Nevertheless, the president&#39;s increasing reliance on authoritarian measures and an economic slump in the late 1990s generated mounting dissatisfaction with his regime, which led to his resignation in 2000. A caretaker government oversaw a new election in the spring of 2001, which installed Alejandro TOLEDO Manrique as the new head of government - Peru&#39;s first democratically elected president of indigenous ethnicity. The presidential election of 2006 saw the return of Alan GARCIA Perez who, after a disappointing presidential term from 1985 to 1990, oversaw a robust economic rebound. Former army officer Ollanta HUMALA Tasso was elected president in June 2011, and carried on the sound, market-oriented economic policies of the three preceding administrations. Poverty and unemployment levels have fallen dramatically in the last decade, and today Peru boasts one of the best performing economies in Latin America. Pedro Pablo KUCZYNSKI Godard won a very narrow presidential runoff election in June 2016. Facing impeachment after evidence surfaced of his involvement in a vote-buying scandal, President KUCZYNSKI offered his resignation on 21 March 2018. Two days later, First Vice President Martin Alberto VIZCARRA Cornejo was sworn in as president. On 30 September 2019, President VIZCARRA invoked his constitutional authority to dissolve Peru&#39;s Congress after months of battling with the body over anticorruption reforms. New congressional elections are scheduled for 26 January 2020.","Western South America, bordering the South Pacific Ocean, between Chile and Ecuador","10 00 S, 76 00 W",South America,"1,285,216 sq km","1,279,996 sq km","5,220 sq km",almost twice the size of Texas;

A wide range of important mineral resources are found in the mountainous and coastal areas, and Peru&#39;s coastal waters provide excellent fishing grounds. Peru is the world&#39;s second largest producer of silver and copper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Peruvian economy grew by an average of 5.6% per year from 2009-13 with a stable exchange rate and low inflation. This growth was due partly to high international prices for Peru&#39;s metals and minerals exports, which account for 55% of the country&#39;s total exports. Growth slipped from 2014 to 2017, due to weaker world prices for these resources. Despite Peru&#39;s strong macroeconomic performance, dependence on minerals and metals exports and imported foodstuffs makes the economy vulnerable to fluctuations in world prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peru&#39;s rapid expansion coupled with cash transfers and other programs have helped to reduce the national poverty rate by over 35 percentage points since 2004, but inequality persists and continued to pose a challenge for the Ollanta HUMALA administration, which championed a policy of social inclusion and a more equitable distribution of income. Poor infrastructure hinders the spread of growth to Peru&#39;s non-coastal areas. The HUMALA administration passed several economic stimulus packages in 2014 to bolster growth, including reforms to environmental regulations in order to spur investment in Peruâ€™s lucrative mining sector, a move that was opposed by some environmental groups. However, in 2015, mining investment fell as global commodity prices remained low and social conflicts plagued the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peru&#39;s free trade policy continued under the HUMALA administration; since 2006, Peru has signed trade deals with the US, Canada, Singapore, China, Korea, Mexico, Japan, the EU, the European Free Trade Association, Chile, Thailand, Costa Rica, Panama, Venezuela, Honduras, concluded negotiations with Guatemala and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and begun trade talks with El Salvador, India, and Turkey. Peru also has signed a trade pact with Chile, Colombia, and Mexico, called the Pacific Alliance, that seeks integration of services, capital, investment and movement of people. Since the US-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement entered into force in February 2009, total trade between Peru and the US has doubled. President Pedro Pablo KUCZYNSKI succeeded HUMALA in July 2016 and is focusing on economic reforms and free market policies aimed at boosting investment in Peru. Mining output increased significantly in 2016-17, which helped Peru attain one of the highest GDP growth rates in Latin America, and Peru should maintain strong growth in 2018.

After remaining almost static for about a decade, Peru&#39;s malnutrition rate began falling in 2005, when the government introduced a coordinated strategy focusing on hygiene, sanitation, and clean water.

Peruvian emigration began rising in the 1980s due to an economic crisis and a violent internal conflict, but outflows have stabilized in the last few years as economic conditions have improved.

PAK,Pakistan,PK,18-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;The Indus Valley civilization, one of the oldest in the world and dating back at least 5,000 years, spread over much of what is presently Pakistan. During the second millennium B.C., remnants of this culture fused with the migrating Indo-Aryan peoples. The area underwent successive invasions in subsequent centuries from the Persians, Greeks, Scythians, Arabs (who brought Islam), Afghans, and Turks. The Mughal Empire flourished in the 16th and 17th centuries; the British came to dominate the region in the 18th century. The separation in 1947 of British India into the Muslim state of Pakistan (with West and East sections) and largely Hindu India was never satisfactorily resolved, and India and Pakistan fought two wars and a limited conflict - in 1947-48, 1965, and 1999 respectively - over the disputed Kashmir territory. A third war between these countries in 1971 - in which India assisted an indigenous movement reacting to the marginalization of Bengalis in Pakistani politics - resulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate nation of Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In response to Indian nuclear weapons testing, Pakistan conducted its own tests in mid-1998. India-Pakistan relations improved in the mid-2000s but have been rocky since the November 2008 Mumbai attacks and have been further strained by attacks in India by militants believed to be based in Pakistan. Imran KHAN took office as prime minister in 2018 after the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) party won a plurality of seats in the July 2018 general elections. Pakistan has been engaged in a decades-long armed conflict with militant groups that target government institutions and civilians, including the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other militant networks.&lt;/p&gt;","Southern Asia, bordering the Arabian Sea, between India on the east and Iran and Afghanistan on the west and China in the north","30 00 N, 70 00 E",Asia,"796,095 sq km","770,875 sq km","25,220 sq km",slightly more than five times the size of Georgia; slightly less than twice the size of California,"7,257 km","Afghanistan 2670 km, China 438 km, India 3190 km, Iran 959 km","1,046 km",12 nm,200 nm,24 nm,200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin,"mostly hot, dry desert; temperate in northwest; arctic in north","divided into three major geographic areas: the northern highlands, the Indus River plain in the center and east, and the Balochistan Plateau in the south and west",900 m,Arabian Sea 0 m,"K2 (Mt.

Pakistan has a large English-speaking population, with English-language skills less prevalent outside urban centers. Despite some progress in recent years in both security and energy, a challenging security environment, electricity shortages, and a burdensome investment climate have traditionally deterred investors. Agriculture accounts for one-fifth of output and two-fifths of employment. Textiles and apparel account for more than half of Pakistan&#39;s export earnings; Pakistan&#39;s failure to diversify its exports has left the country vulnerable to shifts in world demand. Pakistanâ€™s GDP growth has gradually increased since 2012, and was 5.3% in 2017. Official unemployment was 6% in 2017, but this fails to capture the true picture, because much of the economy is informal and underemployment remains high. Human development continues to lag behind most of the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Pakistan embarked on a $6.3 billion IMF Extended Fund Facility, which focused on reducing energy shortages, stabilizing public finances, increasing revenue collection, and improving its balance of payments position. The program concluded in September 2016. Although Pakistan missed several structural reform criteria, it restored macroeconomic stability, improved its credit rating, and boosted growth. The Pakistani rupee has remained relatively stable against the US dollar since 2015, though it declined about 10% between November 2017 and March 2018. Balance of payments concerns have reemerged, however, as a result of a significant increase in imports and weak export and remittance growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pakistan must continue to address several longstanding issues, including expanding investment in education, healthcare, and sanitation; adapting to the effects of climate change and natural disasters; improving the countryâ€™s business environment; and widening the countryâ€™s tax base. Given demographic challenges, Pakistanâ€™s leadership will be pressed to implement economic reforms, promote further development of the energy sector, and attract foreign investment to support sufficient economic growth necessary to employ its growing and rapidly urbanizing population, much of which is under the age of 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an effort to boost development, Pakistan and China are implementing the &quot;China-Pakistan Economic Corridor&quot; (CPEC) with $60 billion in investments targeted towards energy and other infrastructure projects. Pakistan believes CPEC investments will enable growth rates of over 6% of GDP by laying the groundwork for increased exports. CPEC-related obligations, however, have raised IMF concern about Pakistanâ€™s capital outflows and external financing needs over the medium term.&lt;/p&gt;",$1.061 trillion,$305 billion (2017 est.),5.40%,"$5,400 ",12% of GDP,82% (2017 est.),11.3% (2017 est.),14.5% (2017 est.),1.6% (2017 est.),8.2% (2017 est.),-17.6% (2017 est.),24.4% (2016 est.),19.1% (2016 est.),56.5% (2017 est.),"cotton, wheat, rice, sugarcane, fruits, vegetables;

POL,Poland,PL,29-Dec-19,"Poland&#39;s history as a state began near the middle of the 10th century. By the mid-16th century, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ruled a vast tract of land in Central and Eastern Europe. During the 18th century, internal disorders weakened the nation, and in a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795, Russia, Prussia, and Austria partitioned Poland among themselves. Poland regained its independence in 1918 only to be overrun by Germany and the Soviet Union in World War II. It became a Soviet satellite state following the war. Labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union &quot;Solidarity&quot; that over time became a political force with over 10 million members. Free elections in 1989 and 1990 won Solidarity control of the parliament and the presidency, bringing the communist era to a close. A &quot;shock therapy&quot; program during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in Central Europe. Poland joined NATO in 1999 and the EU in 2004. With its transformation to a democratic, market-oriented country largely completed and with large investments in defense, energy, and other infrastructure, Poland is an increasingly active member of Euro-Atlantic organizations.","Central Europe, east of Germany","52 00 N, 20 00 E",Europe,"312,685 sq km","304,255 sq km","8,430 sq km",about twice the size of Georgia;

Since 1990, Poland has pursued a policy of economic liberalization. During the 2008-09 economic slowdown Poland was the only EU country to avoid a recession, in part because of the governmentâ€™s loose fiscal policy combined with a commitment to rein in spending in the medium-term Poland is the largest recipient of EU development funds and their cyclical allocation can significantly impact the rate of economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Polish economy performed well during the 2014-17 period, with the real GDP growth rate generally exceeding 3%, in part because of increases in government social spending that have helped to accelerate consumer-driven growth. However, since 2015, Poland has implemented new business restrictions and taxes on foreign-dominated economic sectors, including banking and insurance, energy, and healthcare, that have dampened investor sentiment and has increased the governmentâ€™s ownership of some firms. The government reduced the retirement age in 2016 and has had mixed success in introducing new taxes and boosting tax compliance to offset the increased costs of social spending programs and relieve upward pressure on the budget deficit. Some credit ratings agencies estimate that Poland during the next few years is at risk of exceeding the EUâ€™s 3%-of-GDP limit on budget deficits, possibly impacting its access to future EU funds. Polandâ€™s economy is projected to perform well in the next few years in part because of an anticipated cyclical increase in the use of its EU development funds and continued, robust household spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poland faces several systemic challenges, which include addressing some of the remaining deficiencies in its road and rail infrastructure, business environment, rigid labor code, commercial court system, government red tape, and burdensome tax system, especially for entrepreneurs. Additional long-term challenges include diversifying Polandâ€™s energy mix, strengthening investments in innovation, research, and development, as well as stemming the outflow of educated young Poles to other EU member states, especially in light of a coming demographic contraction due to emigration, persistently low fertility rates, and the aging of the Solidarity-era baby boom generation.&lt;/p&gt;",$1.126 trillion,$524.8 billion (2017 est.),4.70%,"$29,600 ",20% of GDP,58.6% (2017 est.),17.7% (2017 est.),17.7% (2017 est.),2% (2017 est.),54% (2017 est.),-49.9% (2017 est.),2.4% (2017 est.),40.2% (2017 est.),57.4% (2017 est.),"potatoes, fruits, vegetables, wheat;

QAT,Qatar,QA,23-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;Ruled by the Al Thani family since the mid-1800s, Qatar within the last 60 years transformed itself from a poor British protectorate noted mainly for pearling into an independent state with significant oil and natural gas revenues. Former Amir HAMAD bin Khalifa Al Thani, who overthrew his father in a bloodless coup in 1995, ushered in wide-sweeping political and media reforms, unprecedented economic investment, and a growing Qatari regional leadership role, in part through the creation of the pan-Arab satellite news network Al-Jazeera and Qatar&#39;s mediation of some regional conflicts. In the 2000s, Qatar resolved its longstanding border disputes with both Bahrain and Saudi Arabia and by 2007 had attained the highest per capita income in the world. Qatar did not experience domestic unrest or violence like that seen in other Near Eastern and North African countries in 2011, due in part to its immense wealth and patronage network. In mid-2013, HAMAD peacefully abdicated, transferring power to his son, the current Amir TAMIM bin Hamad. TAMIM is popular with the Qatari public, for his role in shepherding the country through an economic embargo by some other regional countries, for his efforts to improve the country&#39;s healthcare and education systems, and for his expansion of the country&#39;s infrastructure in anticipation of Doha&#39;s hosting of the 2022 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt; Recently, Qatar&amp;rsquo;s relationships with its neighbors have been tense, although since the fall of 2019 there have been signs of improved prospects for a thaw. Following the outbreak of regional unrest in 2011, Doha prided itself on its support for many popular revolutions, particularly in Libya and Syria. This stance was to the detriment of Qatar&amp;rsquo;s relations with Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which temporarily recalled their respective ambassadors from Doha in March 2014. TAMIM later oversaw a warming of Qatar&amp;rsquo;s relations with Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE in November 2014 following Kuwaiti mediation and signing of the Riyadh Agreement. This reconciliation, however, was short-lived.

The country gained recognition of its independence in 1878. It joined the Allied Powers in World War I and acquired new territories - most notably Transylvania - following the conflict. In 1940, Romania allied with the Axis powers and participated in the 1941 German invasion of the USSR. Three years later, overrun by the Soviets, Romania signed an armistice. The post-war Soviet occupation led to the formation of a communist &quot;people&#39;s republic&quot; in 1947 and the abdication of the king. The decades-long rule of dictator Nicolae CEAUSESCU, who took power in 1965, and his Securitate police state became increasingly oppressive and draconian through the 1980s.

Romania&#39;s macroeconomic gains have only recently started to spur creation of a middle class and to address Romania&#39;s widespread poverty. Corruption and red tape continue to permeate the business environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, Romania signed a $26 billion emergency assistance package from the IMF, the EU, and other international lenders, but GDP contracted until 2011. In March 2011, Romania and the IMF/EU/World Bank signed a 24-month precautionary standby agreement, worth $6.6 billion, to promote fiscal discipline, encourage progress on structural reforms, and strengthen financial sector stability; no funds were drawn. In September 2013, Romanian authorities and the IMF/EU agreed to a follow-on standby agreement, worth $5.4 billion, to continue with reforms. This agreement expired in September 2015, and no funds were drawn. Progress on structural reforms has been uneven, and the economy still is vulnerable to external shocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economic growth rebounded in the 2013-17 period, driven by strong industrial exports, excellent agricultural harvests, and, more recently, expansionary fiscal policies in 2016-2017 that nearly quadrupled Bucharestâ€™s annual fiscal deficit, from +0.8% of GDP in 2015 to -3% of GDP in 2016 and an estimated -3.4% in 2017. Industry outperformed other sectors of the economy in 2017. Exports remained an engine of economic growth, led by trade with the EU, which accounts for roughly 70% of Romania trade.

SRB,Russia,RS,18-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;Founded in the 12th century, the Principality of Muscovy was able to emerge from over 200 years of Mongol domination (13th-15th centuries) and to gradually conquer and absorb surrounding principalities. In the early 17th century, a new ROMANOV Dynasty continued this policy of expansion across Siberia to the Pacific. Under PETER I (ruled 1682-1725), hegemony was extended to the Baltic Sea and the country was renamed the Russian Empire. During the 19th century, more territorial acquisitions were made in Europe and Asia. Defeat in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05 contributed to the Revolution of 1905, which resulted in the formation of a parliament and other reforms. Devastating defeats&amp;nbsp;and food shortages&amp;nbsp;in World War I led to widespread rioting in the major cities of the Russian Empire and to the overthrow in 1917 of the ROMANOV Dynasty. The communists under Vladimir LENIN seized power soon after and formed the USSR. The brutal rule of Iosif STALIN (1928-53) strengthened communist rule and Russian dominance of the Soviet Union at a cost of tens of millions of lives. After defeating Germany in World War II as part of an alliance with the US (1939-1945), the USSR expanded its territory and influence in Eastern Europe and emerged as a global power. The USSR was the principal adversary of the US during the Cold War (1947-1991). The Soviet economy and society stagnated in the decades following Stalin&#39;s rule, until General Secretary Mikhail GORBACHEV (1985-91) introduced glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) in an attempt to modernize communism, but his initiatives inadvertently released forces that by December 1991&amp;nbsp;led to the dissolution of&amp;nbsp;the USSR into Russia and 14 other independent states.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Following economic and political turmoil during President Boris YELTSIN&#39;s term (1991-99), Russia shifted toward a centralized authoritarian state under President Vladimir PUTIN (2000-2008, 2012-present) in which the regime seeks to legitimize its rule through managed elections, populist appeals, a foreign policy focused on enhancing the country&#39;s geopolitical influence, and commodity-based economic growth.

Both economic growth and reform have stalled in recent years, however, and Russia remains a predominantly statist economy with a high concentration of wealth in officials&#39; hands. Economic reforms in the 1990s privatized most industry, with notable exceptions in the energy, transportation, banking, and defense-related sectors. The protection of property rights is still weak, and the state continues to interfere in the free operation of the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia is one of the world&#39;s leading producers of oil and natural gas, and is also a top exporter of metals such as steel and primary aluminum. Russia is heavily dependent on the movement of world commodity prices as reliance on commodity exports makes it vulnerable to boom and bust cycles that follow the volatile swings in global prices. The economy, which had averaged 7% growth during the 1998-2008 period as oil prices rose rapidly, has seen diminishing growth rates since then due to the exhaustion of Russiaâ€™s commodity-based growth model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A combination of falling oil prices, international sanctions, and structural limitations pushed Russia into a deep recession in 2015, with GDP falling by close to 2.8%. The downturn continued through 2016, with GDP contracting another 0.2%, but was reversed in 2017 as world demand picked up.

RWA,Rwanda,RW,18-Dec-19,"In 1959, three years before independence from Belgium, the majority ethnic group, the Hutus, overthrew the ruling Tutsi king. Over the next several years, thousands of Tutsis were killed, and some 150,000 driven into exile in neighboring countries. The children of these exiles later formed a rebel group, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), and began a civil war in 1990. The war, along with several political and economic upheavals, exacerbated ethnic tensions, culminating in April 1994 in a state-orchestrated genocide, in which Rwandans killed over 800,000 of their fellow citizens, including approximately three-quarters of the Tutsi population. The genocide ended later that same year when the predominantly Tutsi RPF, operating out of Uganda and northern Rwanda, defeated the national army and Hutu militias, and established an RPF-led government of national unity. Rwanda held its first local elections in 1999 and its first post-genocide presidential and legislative elections in 2003. Rwanda joined the Commonwealth in late 2009.

Population density is high but, with the exception of the capital Kigali, is not concentrated in large cities â€“ its 12 million people are spread out on a small amount of land (smaller than the state of Maryland). Tourism, minerals, coffee, and tea are Rwanda&#39;s main sources of foreign exchange. Despite Rwanda&#39;s fertile ecosystem, food production often does not keep pace with demand, requiring food imports. Energy shortages, instability in neighboring states, and lack of adequate transportation linkages to other countries continue to handicap private sector growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1994 genocide decimated Rwanda&#39;s fragile economic base, severely impoverished the population, particularly women, and temporarily stalled the country&#39;s ability to attract private and external investment. However, Rwanda has made substantial progress in stabilizing and rehabilitating its economy well beyond pre-1994 levels. GDP has rebounded with an average annual growth of 6%-8% since 2003 and inflation has been reduced to single digits. In 2015, 39% of the population lived below the poverty line, according to government statistics, compared to 57% in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government has embraced an expansionary fiscal policy to reduce poverty by improving education, infrastructure, and foreign and domestic investment. Rwanda consistently ranks well for ease of doing business and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rwandan Government is seeking to become a regional leader in information and communication technologies and aims to reach middle-income status by 2020 by leveraging the service industry. In 2012, Rwanda completed the first modern Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Kigali. The SEZ seeks to attract investment in all sectors, but specifically in agribusiness, information and communications, trade and logistics, mining, and construction. In 2016, the government launched an online system to give investors information about public land and its suitability for agricultural development.&lt;/p&gt;",$24.68 billion,$9.136 billion (2017 est.),6.10%,"$2,100 ",12.5% of GDP,75.9% (2017 est.),15.2% (2017 est.),22.9% (2017 est.),0.5% (2017 est.),18.2% (2017 est.),-32.8% (2017 est.),30.9% (2017 est.),17.6% (2017 est.),51.5% (2017 est.),"coffee, tea, pyrethrum (insecticide made from chrysanthemums), bananas, beans, sorghum, potatoes; livestock","cement, agricultural products, small-scale beverages, soap, furniture, shoes, plastic goods, textiles, cigarettes",4.2% (2017 est.),6.227 million (2017 est.),75.30%,6.70%,18% (2012 est.),2.70%,39.1% (2015 est.),2.10%,43.2% (2011 est.),1.943 billion (2017 est.),2.337 billion (2017 est.),21.3% (of GDP) (2017 est.),-4.3% (of GDP) (2017 est.),40.5% of GDP,calendar year,4.80%,11.25%,17.29%,$895 million,$895 million,$1.614 billion,&lt;p&gt;NA&lt;/p&gt;,-$622 million,$1.05 billion,"UAE 38.3%, Kenya 15.1%, Switzerland 9.9%, Democratic Republic of the Congo 9.5%, US 4.9%, Singapore 4.5% (2017)","coffee, tea, hides, tin ore",$1.922 billion,"foodstuffs, machinery and equipment, steel, petroleum products, cement and construction material","China 20.4%, Uganda 11%, India 7.2%, Kenya 7.1%, Tanzania 5.3%, UAE 5.1% (2017)",$1.104 billion,$2.611 billion,$2.072 billion,$26.8 million,Rwandan francs (RWF) per US dollar -,,525 million kWh (2016 est.),527.3 million kWh (2016 est.),4 million kWh (2015 est.),42 million kWh (2016 est.),"191,000 kW (2016 est.)",42% of total installed capacity (2016 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),51% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),7% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),0 bbl/day (2018 est.),0 bbl/day (2015 est.),0 bbl/day (2015 est.),0 bbl (1 January 2018 est.),0 bbl/day (2015 est.),"6,700 bbl/day (2016 est.)",0 bbl/day (2015 est.),"6,628 bbl/day (2015 est.)",0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),56.63 billion cu m (1 January 2018 est.),"985,600 Mt (2017 est.)","12,333", less than 1 (December 2017 est.)

Increases in educational attainment, particularly among girls, and exposure to social media also contributed to the reduction in the birth rate. The average number of births per woman decreased from a 5.6 in 2005 to 4.5 in 2016. Despite these significant strides in reducing fertility, Rwandaâ€™s birth rate remains very high and will continue to for an extended period of time because of its large population entering reproductive age. Because Rwanda is one of the most densely populated countries in Africa, its persistent high population growth and increasingly small agricultural landholdings will put additional strain on familiesâ€™ ability to raise foodstuffs and access potable water. These conditions will also hinder the governmentâ€™s efforts to reduce poverty and prevent environmental degradation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UNHCR recommended that effective 30 June 2013 countries invoke a cessation of refugee status for those Rwandans who fled their homeland between 1959 and 1998, including the 1994 genocide, on the grounds that the conditions that drove them to seek protection abroad no longer exist. The UNHCRâ€™s decision is controversial because many Rwandan refugees still fear persecution if they return home, concerns that are supported by the number of Rwandans granted asylum since 1998 and by the number exempted from the cessation. Rwandan refugees can still seek an exemption or local integration, but host countries are anxious to send the refugees back to Rwanda and are likely to avoid options that enable them to stay. Conversely, Rwanda itself hosts almost 160,000 refugees as of 2017; virtually all of them fleeing conflict in neighboring Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.&lt;/p&gt;",,,,,,,"76,366 (Democratic Republic of the Congo), 72,932 (Burundi) (2019)",,,,none (landlocked),,,,rabies (2016),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SAU,Saudi Arabia,SA,23-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia is the birthplace of Islam and home to Islam&#39;s two holiest shrines in Mecca and Medina. The king&#39;s official title is the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. The modern Saudi state was founded in 1932 by ABD AL-AZIZ bin Abd al-Rahman Al SAUD (Ibn Saud) after a 30-year campaign to unify most of the Arabian Peninsula. One of his male descendants rules the country today, as required by the country&#39;s 1992 Basic Law. Following Iraq&#39;s invasion of Kuwait in 1990, Saudi Arabia accepted the Kuwaiti royal family and 400,000 refugees while allowing Western and Arab troops to deploy on its soil for the liberation of Kuwait the following year. The continuing presence of foreign troops on Saudi soil after the liberation of Kuwait became a source of tension between the royal family and the public until all operational US troops left the country in 2003. Major terrorist attacks in May and November 2003 spurred a strong ongoing campaign against domestic terrorism and extremism. US troops returned to the Kingdom in October 2019 after attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From 2005 to 2015, King ABDALLAH bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud incrementally modernized the Kingdom. Driven by personal ideology and political pragmatism, he introduced a series of social and economic initiatives, including expanding employment and social opportunities for women, attracting foreign investment, increasing the role of the private sector in the economy, and discouraging businesses from hiring foreign workers. These reforms have accelerated under King SALMAN bin Abd al-Aziz, who ascended to the throne in 2015, and has since lifted the Kingdom&#39;s ban on women driving and allowed cinemas to operate for the first time in decades.&amp;nbsp;Saudi Arabia saw some protests during the 2011 Arab Spring but not the level of bloodshed seen in protests elsewhere in the region. Shia Muslims in the Eastern Province protested primarily against the detention of political prisoners, endemic discrimination, and Bahraini and Saudi Government actions in Bahrain. Riyadh took a cautious but firm approach by arresting some protesters but releasing most of them quickly and by using its state-sponsored clerics to counter political and Islamist activism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The government held its first-ever elections in 2005 and 2011, when Saudis went to the polls to elect municipal councilors. In December 2015, women were allowed to vote and stand as candidates for the first time in municipal council elections, with 19 women winning seats. After King SALMAN ascended to the throne in 2015, he placed the first next-generation prince, MUHAMMAD BIN NAYIF bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud, in the line of succession as Crown Prince. He designated his son, MUHAMMAD BIN SALMAN bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud, as the Deputy Crown Prince. In March 2015, Saudi Arabia led a coalition of 10 countries in a military campaign to restore the legitimate government of Yemen, which had been ousted by Huthi forces allied with former president ALI ABDULLAH al-Salih. The war in Yemen has drawn international criticism for civilian casualties and its effect on the country&amp;rsquo;s dire humanitarian situation. In December 2015, then Deputy Crown Prince MUHAMMAD BIN SALMAN announced Saudi Arabia would lead a 34-nation Islamic Coalition to fight terrorism (it has since grown to 41 nations). In May 2017, Saudi Arabia inaugurated the Global Center for Combatting Extremist Ideology (also known as &quot;Etidal&quot;) as part of its ongoing efforts to counter violent extremism. In June 2017, King SALMAN elevated MUHAMMAD BIN SALMAN to Crown Prince.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The country remains a leading producer of oil and natural gas and holds about 16% of the world&#39;s proven oil reserves as of 2015. The government continues to pursue economic reform and diversification, particularly since Saudi Arabia&#39;s accession to the WTO in 2005, and promotes foreign investment in the Kingdom. In April 2016, the Saudi Government announced a broad set of socio-economic reforms, known as Vision 2030. Low global oil prices throughout 2015 and 2016 significantly lowered Saudi Arabia&amp;rsquo;s governmental revenue. In response, the government cut subsidies on water, electricity, and gasoline; reduced government employee compensation packages; and announced limited new land taxes. In coordination with OPEC and some key non-OPEC countries, Saudi Arabia agreed cut oil output in early 2017 to regulate supply and help elevate global prices.&lt;/p&gt;","Middle East, bordering the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, north of Yemen","25 00 N, 45 00 E",Middle East,"2,149,690 sq km","2,149,690 sq km",0 sq km,slightly more than one-fifth the size of the US,"4,272 km","Iraq 811 km, Jordan 731 km, Kuwait 221 km, Oman 658 km, Qatar 87 km, UAE 457 km, Yemen 1307 km","2,640 km",12 nm,,18 nm, not specified,"harsh, dry desert with great temperature extremes",mostly sandy desert,665 m,Persian Gulf 0 m,"Jabal Sawda&#39;

It possesses about 16% of the world&#39;s proven petroleum reserves, ranks as the largest exporter of petroleum, and plays a leading role in OPEC. The petroleum sector accounts for roughly 87% of budget revenues, 42% of GDP, and 90% of export earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia is encouraging the growth of the private sector in order to diversify its economy and to employ more Saudi nationals. Approximately 6 million foreign workers play an important role in the Saudi economy, particularly in the oil and service sectors; at the same time, however, Riyadh is struggling to reduce unemployment among its own nationals. Saudi officials are particularly focused on employing its large youth population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, the Kingdom incurred a budget deficit estimated at 8.3% of GDP, which was financed by bond sales and drawing down reserves. Although the Kingdom can finance high deficits for several years by drawing down its considerable foreign assets or by borrowing, it has cut capital spending and reduced subsidies on electricity, water, and petroleum products and recently introduced a value-added tax of 5%. In January 2016, Crown Prince and Deputy Prime Minister MUHAMMAD BIN SALMAN announced that Saudi Arabia intends to list shares of its state-owned petroleum company, ARAMCO - another move to increase revenue and outside investment. The government has also looked at privatization and diversification of the economy more closely in the wake of a diminished oil market. Historically, Saudi Arabia has focused diversification efforts on power generation, telecommunications, natural gas exploration, and petrochemical sectors. More recently, the government has approached investors about expanding the role of the private sector in the health care, education and tourism industries. While Saudi Arabia has emphasized their goals of diversification for some time, current low oil prices may force the government to make more drastic changes ahead of their long-run timeline.&lt;/p&gt;",$1.775 trillion,$686.7 billion (2017 est.),-0.90%,"$54,500 ",30.1% of GDP,41.3% (2017 est.),24.5% (2017 est.),23.2% (2017 est.),4.7% (2017 est.),34.8% (2017 est.),-28.6% (2017 est.),2.6% (2017 est.),44.2% (2017 est.),53.2% (2017 est.),"wheat, barley, tomatoes, melons, dates, citrus;

SYC,Saint Kitts and Nevis,SC,18-Dec-19,"Carib Indians occupied the islands of the West Indies for hundreds of years before the British and French began settlement in 1623. During the course of 17th century, Saint Kitts became the premier base for English and French expansion into the Caribbean. The French ceded the territory to the UK in 1713. At the turn of the 18th century, Saint Kitts was the richest British Crown Colony per capita in the Caribbean, a result of the sugar trade. Although small in size and separated by only 3 km (2 mi) of water, Saint Kitts and Nevis were viewed and governed as different states until the late-19th century, when the British forcibly unified them along with the island of Anguilla. In 1967, the island territory of Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla became an associated state of the UK with full internal autonomy. The island of Anguilla rebelled and was allowed to secede in 1971. The remaining islands achieved independence in 1983 as Saint Kitts and Nevis. In 1998, a referendum on Nevis to separate from Saint Kitts fell short of the two-thirds majority vote needed.","Caribbean, islands in the Caribbean Sea, about one-third of the way from Puerto Rico to Trinidad and Tobago","17 20 N, 62 45 W",Central America and the Caribbean,261 sq km (Saint Kitts 168 sq km;

Growth has been led by the tourism sector, which directly employs about 26% of the labor force and directly and indirectly accounts for more than 55% of GDP, and by tuna fishing. In recent years, the government has encouraged foreign investment to upgrade hotels and tourism industry services. At the same time, the government has moved to reduce the dependence on tourism by promoting the development of the offshore financial, information, and communication sectors and renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2008, having depleted its foreign exchange reserves, Seychelles defaulted on interest payments due on a $230 million Eurobond, requested assistance from the IMF, and immediately enacted a number of significant structural reforms, including liberalization of the exchange rate, reform of the public sector to include layoffs, and the sale of some state assets. In December 2013, the IMF declared that Seychelles had successfully transitioned to a market-based economy with full employment and a fiscal surplus. However, state-owned enterprises still play a prominent role in the economy. Effective 1 January 2017, Seychelles was no longer eligible for trade benefits under the US African Growth and Opportunities Act after having gained developed country status. Seychelles grew at 5% in 2017 because of a strong tourism sector and low commodity prices. The Seychellois Government met the IMF&amp;rsquo;s performance criteria for 2017 but recognizes a need to make additional progress to reduce high income inequality, represented by a Gini coefficient of 46.8.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a very small open economy dependent on tourism, Seychelles remains vulnerable to developments such as economic downturns in countries that supply tourists, natural disasters, and changes in local climatic conditions and ocean temperature. One of the main challenges facing the government is implementing strategies that will increase Seychelles&#39; long-term resilience to climate change without weakening economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;",$2.75 billion,$1.498 billion (2017 est.),5.30%,"$29,300 ",8.1% of GDP,52.7% (2017 est.),34.4% (2017 est.),26.7% (2017 est.),0% (2017 est.),79.4% (2017 est.),-93.2% (2017 est.),2.5% (2017 est.),13.8% (2017 est.),83.7% (2017 est.),"coconuts, cinnamon, vanilla, sweet potatoes, cassava (manioc, tapioca), copra, bananas; tuna","fishing, tourism, beverages",2.3% (2017 est.),"47,210 (2017 est.)",3%,23%,74% (2006),3%,39.3% (2013 est.),4.70%,15.4% (2007),593.4 million (2017 est.),600.7 million (2017 est.),39.6% (of GDP) (2017 est.),-0.5% (of GDP) (2017 est.),63.6% of GDP,calendar year,2.90%,11.17%,12.36%,$556.5 million,$556.5 million,$565.9 million,&lt;p&gt;NA&lt;/p&gt;,-$307 million,$564.8 million,"UAE 28.5%, France 24%, UK 13.8%, Italy 8.9%, Germany 4.6% (2017)","canned tuna, frozen fish, petroleum products (reexports)",$1.155 billion,"machinery and equipment, foodstuffs, petroleum products, chemicals, other manufactured goods","UAE 13.4%, France 9.4%, Spain 5.7%, South Africa 5% (2017)",$523.5 million,$2.651 billion,,,Seychelles rupees (SCR) per US dollar -,100% (2016),350 million kWh (2016 est.),325.5 million kWh (2016 est.),0 kWh (2016 est.),0 kWh (2016 est.),"88,000 kW (2016 est.)",91% of total installed capacity (2016 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),9% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),0 bbl/day (2018 est.),0 bbl/day (2015 est.),0 bbl/day (2015 est.),0 bbl (1 January 2018 est.),0 bbl/day (2015 est.),"7,300 bbl/day (2016 est.)",0 bbl/day (2015 est.),"7,225 bbl/day (2015 est.)",0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (1 January 2014 est.),1.15 million Mt (2017 est.),"19,652",21 (2017 est.),"167,282",178 (2017 est.),effective system; radiotelephone communications between islands in the archipelago (2018),fixed-line 21 per 100 and mobile-cellular teledensity is&amp;nbsp;178 telephones per 100 persons (2018),"country code - 248; landing points for the PEACE and the SEAS submarine cables&amp;nbsp;providing connectivity to Europe, the Middle East Africa and Asia; direct radiotelephone communications with adjacent island countries and African coastal countries; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Indian Ocean) (2019)","&lt;p&gt;the national broadcaster, Seychelles Broadcasting Corporation (SBC), which is funded by taxpayer money, operates the only terrestrial TV station, which provides local programming and airs broadcasts from international services; a privately owned Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) channel also provides local programming multi-channel cable and satellite TV are available through 2 providers; the national broadcaster operates 1 AM and 1 FM radio station; there are 2 privately operated radio stations; transmissions of 2 international broadcasters are accessible in Victoria&lt;/p&gt; (2019)",.sc,"52,664",56.5% (July 2016 est.),"15,221",16 (2017 est.),1.44% of GDP,"Seychelles People&amp;rsquo;s Defence Forces (SPDF): Army (includes infantry, Special Forces (Tazar), and Presidential Security Unit), Coast Guard, and Air Force (2019)",18-28 years of age for voluntary military service (18-25 for officers); 6-year initial commitment; no conscription (2019),1 (2015),3 (2015),"497,496 (2015)","19,234,992 mt-km (2015)",S7 (2016),14 (2013),7 (2017),,1 (2017),,5 (2017),1 (2017),7 (2013),,,,2 (2013),5 (2013),1 (2013),,526 km (2015),514 km (2015),24,"general cargo 4, oil tanker 6, other 14 (2018)",,,,&lt;p&gt;Mauritius and Seychelles claim the Chagos Islands (UK-administered British Indian Ocean Territory)&lt;/p&gt;,,,,,,,3.6% (2012),,46.8,,,,,,,12 km (2015),,Victoria,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"&lt;p&gt;Seychelles has no indigenous population and was first permanently settled by a small group of French planters, African slaves, and South Indians in 1770. Seychellesâ€™ modern population is composed of the descendants of French and later British settlers, Africans, and Indian, Chinese, and Middle Eastern traders and is concentrated on three of its 155 islands â€“ the vast majority on Mahe and lesser numbers on Praslin and La Digue. Seychellesâ€™ population grew rapidly during the second half of the 20th century, largely due to natural increase, but the pace has slowed because of fertility decline. The total fertility rate dropped sharply from 4.0 children per woman in 1980 to 1.9 in 2015, mainly as a result of a family planning program, free education and health care, and increased female labor force participation. Life expectancy has increased steadily, but women on average live 9 years longer than men, a difference that is higher than that typical of developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of reduced fertility and increased longevity has resulted in an aging population, which will put pressure on the governmentâ€™s provision of pensions and health care. Seychellesâ€™ sustained investment in social welfare services, such as free primary health care and education up to the post-secondary level, have enabled the country to achieve a high human development index score â€“ among the highest in Africa. Despite some of its health and education indicators being nearly on par with Western countries, Seychelles has a high level of income inequality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An increasing number of migrant workers â€“ mainly young men â€“ have been coming to Seychelles in recent years to work in the construction and tourism industries.

SGP,Senegal,SG,23-Dec-19,"The French colonies of Senegal and French Sudan were merged in 1959 and granted independence in 1960 as the Mali Federation. The union broke up after only a few months. Senegal joined with The Gambia to form the nominal confederation of Senegambia in 1982. The envisaged integration of the two countries was never implemented, and the union was dissolved in 1989. The Movement of Democratic Forces in the Casamance has led a low-level separatist insurgency in southern Senegal since the 1980s. Several attempts at reaching a comprehensive peace agreement have failed to resolve the conflict but, despite sporadic incidents of violence, an unofficial cease-fire has remained largely in effect since 2012. Senegal remains one of the most stable democracies in Africa and has a long history of participating in international peacekeeping and regional mediation. Senegal was ruled by the Socialist Party of Senegal, first under President L&amp;eacute;opold S&amp;eacute;dar SENGHOR, and then President Abdou DIOUF, for 40 years until Abdoulaye WADE was elected president in 2000. He was re-elected in 2007 and during his two terms amended Senegal&#39;s constitution over a dozen times to increase executive power and weaken the opposition. His decision to run for a third presidential term sparked a large public backlash that led to his defeat in a March 2012 runoff with Macky SALL. A 2016 constitutional referendum reduced the term to five years with a maximum of two consecutive terms for future presidents - the change did not apply to SALL&#39;s first term. SALL won his bid for re-election in February 2019; his term will end in 2024. A month after the election, the National Assembly voted to abolish the office of the prime minister. Opposition organizations and civil society have criticized the decision as a further concentration of power in the executive branch at the expense of the legislative and judicial branches.","Western Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between Guinea-Bissau and Mauritania","14 00 N, 14 00 W",Africa,"196,722 sq km","192,530 sq km","4,192 sq km",slightly smaller than South Dakota;

It relies heavily on donor assistance, remittances and foreign direct investment.

President SALL unveiled an ambitious economic plan, the Emerging Senegal Plan (ESP), which aims to implement priority economic reforms and investment projects to increase economic growth while preserving macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability. Bureaucratic bottlenecks and a challenging business climate are among the perennial challenges that may slow the implementation of this plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senegal receives technical support from the IMF under a Policy Support Instrument (PSI) to assist with implementation of the ESP. The PSI implementation continues to be satisfactory as concluded by the IMFâ€™s fifth review in December 2017. Financial markets have signaled confidence in Senegal through successful Eurobond issuances in 2014, 2017, and 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government is focusing on 19 projects under the ESP to continue The governmentâ€™s goal under the ESP is structural transformation of the economy.

In 1918, the Slovenes joined the Serbs and Croats in forming a new multinational state, which was named Yugoslavia in 1929. After World War II, Slovenia was one of the republics in the restored Yugoslavia, which, though communist, soon distanced itself from the Soviet Union and spearheaded the Non-Aligned Movement. Dissatisfied with the exercise of power by the majority Serbs, the Slovenes succeeded in establishing their independence in 1991 after a short 10-day war. Historical ties to Western Europe, a growing economy, and a stable democracy have assisted in Slovenia&#39;s postcommunist transition.

SLE,Sierra Leone,SL,18-Dec-19,"The British set up a trading post near present-day Freetown in the 17th century. Originally, the trade involved timber and ivory, but later it expanded to slaves. Following the American Revolution, a colony was established in 1787 and Sierra Leone became a destination for resettling black loyalists who had originally been resettled in Nova Scotia. After the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, British crews delivered thousands of Africans liberated from illegal slave ships to Sierra Leone, particularly Freetown. The colony gradually expanded inland during the course of the 19th century; independence was attained in 1961. Democracy is slowly being reestablished after the civil war (1991-2002) that resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and the displacement of more than 2 million people (about one-third of the population). The military, which took over full responsibility for security following the departure of UN peacekeepers at the end of 2005, has developed as a guarantor of the country&#39;s stability; the armed forces remained on the sideline during the 2007, 2012, and 2018 national elections. In March 2014, the closure of the UN Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Sierra Leone marked the end of more than 15 years of peacekeeping and political operations in Sierra Leone.

The countryâ€™s principal exports are iron ore, diamonds, and rutile, and the economy is vulnerable to fluctuations in international prices. Until 2014, the government had relied on external assistance to support its budget, but it was gradually becoming more independent. The Ebola outbreak of 2014 and 2015, combined with falling global commodities prices, caused a significant contraction of economic activity in all areas. While the World Health Organization declared an end to the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone in November 2015, low commodity prices in 2015-2016 contributed to the countryâ€™s biggest fiscal shortfall since 2001. In 2017, increased iron ore exports, together with the end of the Ebola epidemic, supported a resumption of economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continued economic growth will depend on rising commodities prices and increased efforts to diversify the sources of growth. Non-mining activities will remain constrained by inadequate infrastructure, such as power and roads, even though power sector projects may provide some additional electricity capacity in the near term. Pervasive corruption and undeveloped human capital will continue to deter foreign investors.

Its elevated TFR is sustained by the continued desire for large families, the low level of contraceptive use, and the early start of childbearing. Despite its high TFR, Sierra Leoneâ€™s population growth is somewhat tempered by high infant, child, and maternal mortality rates that are among the worldâ€™s highest and are a result of poverty, a lack of potable water and sanitation, poor nutrition, limited access to quality health care services, and the prevalence of female genital cutting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sierra Leoneâ€™s large youth cohort â€“ about 60% of the population is under the age of 25 â€“ continues to struggle with high levels of unemployment, which was one of the major causes of the countryâ€™s 1991-2002 civil war and remains a threat to stability today.

The manufacturing and financial sectors account for more than half of San Marino&#39;s GDP. The per capita level of output and standard of living are comparable to those of the most prosperous regions of Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;San Marino&#39;s economy contracted considerably in the years since 2008, largely due to weakened demand from Italy - which accounts for nearly 90% of its export market - and financial sector consolidation. Difficulties in the banking sector, the global economic downturn, and the sizable decline in tax revenues all contributed to negative real GDP growth. The government adopted measures to counter the downturn, including subsidized credit to businesses and is seeking to shift its growth model away from a reliance on bank and tax secrecy. San Marino does not issue public debt securities; when necessary, it finances deficits by drawing down central bank deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economy benefits from foreign investment due to its relatively low corporate taxes and low taxes on interest earnings. The income tax rate is also very low, about one-third the average EU level. San Marino continues to work towards harmonizing its fiscal laws with EU and international standards. In September 2009, the OECD removed San Marino from its list of tax havens that have yet to fully adopt global tax standards, and in 2010 San Marino signed Tax Information Exchange Agreements with most major countries. In 2013, the San Marino Government signed a Double Taxation Agreement with Italy, but a referendum on EU membership failed to reach the quorum needed to bring it to a vote.&lt;/p&gt;",$2.064 billion,$1.643 billion (2017 est.),1.90%,"$59,000 ",, NA (2011 est.), NA (2011 est.), NA (2011 est.), NA (2011 est.),176.6% (2011),-153.3% (2011),0.1% (2009),39.2% (2009),60.7% (2009),"wheat, grapes, corn, olives; cattle, pigs, horses, beef, cheese, hides","tourism, banking, textiles, electronics, ceramics, cement, wine",-1.1% (2012 est.),"21,960 (September 2013 est.)",0.20%,33.50%,66.3% (September 2013 est.),8.10%, NA, NA, NA,667.7 million (2011 est.),715.3 million (2011 est.),40.6% (of GDP) (2011 est.),-2.9% (of GDP) (2011 est.),24.1% of GDP,calendar year,1%,,5.38%,$1.326 billion,$4.584 billion,$8.008 billion,&lt;p&gt;NA&lt;/p&gt;,$0 ,$3.827 billion,,"building stone, lime, wood, chestnuts, wheat, wine, baked goods, hides, ceramics",$2.551 billion,"wide variety of consumer manufactures, food, energy",,$392 million,&lt;p&gt;NA&lt;/p&gt;,,,euros (EUR) per US dollar -,100% (2016),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"15,800",47 (2017 est.),"38,000",113 (2017 est.),automatic telephone system completely integrated into Italian system (2018),fixed-line 47 per 100 and mobile-cellular teledensity&amp;nbsp;113 telephones per 100 persons (2018),country code - 378; connected to Italian international network,state-owned public broadcaster operates 1 TV station and 3 radio stations; receives radio and TV broadcasts from Italy (2019),.sm,"17,200",52.6% (July 2016 est.),"12,500",37 (2017 est.),,"No regular military forces; Voluntary Military Corps (Corpi Militari), which includes a Uniformed Militia (performs ceremonial duties and limited police support functions) and Guard of the Great and General Council (defends the Captains Regent and the Great and General Council, participates in official ceremonies, cooperates with the maintenance of public order on special occasions, and performs guard duties during parliamentary sittings).&amp;nbsp; The Police Corps includes the Gendarmerie, which is responsible for maintaining public order, protecting citizens and their property, and providing assistance during disasters.

SEN,Singapore,SN,29-Dec-19,A Malay trading port known as Temasek existed on the island of Singapore by the 14th century. The settlement changed hands several times in the ensuing centuries and was eventually burned in the 17th century and fell into obscurity. The British founded modern Singapore as a trading colony on the site in 1819. It joined the Malaysian Federation in 1963 but was ousted two years later and became independent. Singapore subsequently became one of the world&#39;s most prosperous countries with strong international trading links (its port is one of the world&#39;s busiest in terms of tonnage handled) and with per capita GDP equal to that of the leading nations of Western Europe.,"Southeastern Asia, islands between Malaysia and Indonesia","1 22 N, 103 48 E",Southeast Asia,719.2 sq km,709.2 sq km,10 sq km,"slightly more than 3.5 times the size of Washington, DC",,,193 km,3 nm,,,,"tropical;

SOM,Somalia,SO,18-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;Britain withdrew from British Somaliland in 1960 to allow its protectorate to join with Italian Somaliland and form the new nation of Somalia. In 1969, a coup headed by Mohamed SIAD Barre ushered in an authoritarian socialist rule characterized by the persecution, jailing, and torture of political opponents and dissidents. After the regime&#39;s collapse early in 1991, Somalia descended into turmoil, factional fighting, and anarchy. In May 1991, northern clans declared an independent Republic of Somaliland that now includes the administrative regions of Awdal, Woqooyi Galbeed, Togdheer, Sanaag, and Sool. Although not recognized by any government, this entity has maintained a stable existence and continues efforts to establish a constitutional democracy, including holding municipal, parliamentary, and presidential elections. The regions of Bari, Nugaal, and northern Mudug comprise a neighboring semi-autonomous state of Puntland, which has been self-governing since 1998 but does not aim at independence; it has also made strides toward reconstructing a legitimate, representative government but has suffered some civil strife. Puntland disputes its border with Somaliland as it also claims the regions of Sool and Sanaag, and portions of Togdheer. Beginning in 1993, a two-year UN humanitarian effort (primarily in south-central Somalia) was able to alleviate famine conditions, but when the UN withdrew in 1995, having suffered significant casualties, order still had not been restored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2000, the Somalia National Peace Conference (SNPC) held in Djibouti resulted in the formation of an interim government, known as the Transitional National Government (TNG). When the TNG failed to establish adequate security or governing institutions, the Government of Kenya, under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), led a subsequent peace process that concluded in October 2004 with the election of Abdullahi YUSUF Ahmed as President of a second interim government, known as the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) of the Somali Republic. The TFG included a 275-member parliamentary body, known as the Transitional Federal Parliament (TFP). President YUSUF resigned late in 2008 while UN-sponsored talks between the TFG and the opposition Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia (ARS) were underway in Djibouti. In January 2009, following the creation of a TFG-ARS unity government, Ethiopian military forces, which had entered Somalia in December 2006 to support the TFG in the face of advances by the opposition Islamic Courts Union (ICU), withdrew from the country. The TFP was doubled in size to 550 seats with the addition of 200 ARS and 75 civil society members of parliament. The expanded parliament elected Sheikh SHARIF Sheikh Ahmed, the former ICU and ARS chairman as president in January 2009. The creation of the TFG was based on the Transitional Federal Charter (TFC), which outlined a five-year mandate leading to the establishment of a new Somali constitution and a transition to a representative government following national elections. In 2009, the TFP amended the TFC to extend TFG&#39;s mandate until 2011 and in 2011 Somali principals agreed to institute political transition by August 2012. The transition process ended in September 2012 when clan elders replaced the TFP by appointing 275 members to a new parliament who subsequently elected a new president.&lt;/p&gt;","Eastern Africa, bordering the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean, east of Ethiopia","10 00 N, 49 00 E",Africa,"637,657 sq km","627,337 sq km","10,320 sq km",almost five times the size of Alabama;

Nomads and semi-pastoralists, who are dependent upon livestock for their livelihood, make up a large portion of the population. Economic activity is estimated to have increased by 2.4% in 2017 because of growth in the agriculture, construction and telecommunications sector.

Mogadishu&#39;s main market offers a variety of goods from food to electronic gadgets. Hotels continue to operate and are supported with private-security militias. Formalized economic growth has yet to expand outside of Mogadishu and a few regional capitals, and within the city, security concerns dominate business. Telecommunication firms provide wireless services in most major cities and offer the lowest international call rates on the continent.

Despite civil war and famine raising its mortality rate, Somaliaâ€™s high fertility rate and large proportion of people of reproductive age maintain rapid population growth, with each generation being larger than the prior one. More than 60% of Somaliaâ€™s population is younger than 25, and the fertility rate is among the worldâ€™s highest at almost 6 children per woman â€“ a rate that has decreased little since the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lack of educational and job opportunities is a major source of tension for Somaliaâ€™s large youth cohort, making them vulnerable to recruitment by extremist and pirate groups. Somalia has one of the worldâ€™s lowest primary school enrollment rates â€“ just over 40% of children are in school â€“ and one of worldâ€™s highest youth unemployment rates. Life expectancy is low as a result of high infant and maternal mortality rates, the spread of preventable diseases, poor sanitation, chronic malnutrition, and inadequate health services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the two decades of conflict that followed the fall of the SIAD regime in 1991, hundreds of thousands of Somalis fled their homes. Today Somalia is the worldâ€™s third highest source country for refugees, after Syria and Afghanistan. Insecurity, drought, floods, food shortages, and a lack of economic opportunities are the driving factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 2016, more than 1.1 million Somali refugees were hosted in the region, mainly in Kenya, Yemen, Egypt, Ethiopia, Djibouti, and Uganda, while more than 1.1 million Somalis were internally displaced. Since the implementation of a tripartite voluntary repatriation agreement among Kenya, Somalia, and the UNHCR in 2013, nearly 40,000 Somali refugees have returned home from Kenyaâ€™s Dadaab refugee camp â€“ still houses to approximately 260,000 Somalis. The flow sped up rapidly after the Kenyan Government in May 2016 announced its intention to close the camp, worsening security and humanitarian conditions in receiving communities in south-central Somalia. Despite the conflict in Yemen, thousands of Somalis and other refugees and asylum seekers from the Horn of Africa risk their lives crossing the Gulf of Aden to reach Yemen and beyond (often Saudi Arabia).

Even after the abolition of slavery on its plantations in 1834, Saint Lucia remained an agricultural island, dedicated to producing tropical commodity crops.

Although US, UK, Dutch, and Swedish coal companies have mined in the past, the only companies still engaging in this are Norwegian and Russian. Low coal prices have forced the Norwegian coal company, Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani, to close one of its two mines and to considerably reduce the activity of the other.

SYR,Syria,SY,23-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;Following World War I, France acquired a mandate over the northern portion of the former Ottoman Empire province of Syria. The French administered the area as Syria until granting it independence in 1946. The new country lacked political stability and experienced a series of military coups. Syria united with Egypt in February 1958 to form the United Arab Republic. In September 1961, the two entities separated, and the Syrian Arab Republic was reestablished. In the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, Syria lost the Golan Heights region to Israel. During the 1990s, Syria and Israel held occasional, albeit unsuccessful, peace talks over its return. In November 1970, Hafiz al-ASAD, a member of the socialist Ba&#39;ath Party and the minority Alawi sect, seized power in a bloodless coup and brought political stability to the country. Following the death of President Hafiz al-ASAD, his son, Bashar al-ASAD, was approved as president by popular referendum in July 2000. Syrian troops - stationed in Lebanon since 1976 in an ostensible peacekeeping role - were withdrawn in April 2005. During the July-August 2006 conflict between Israel and Hizballah, Syria placed its military forces on alert but did not intervene directly on behalf of its ally Hizballah. In May 2007, Bashar al-ASAD&#39;s second term as president was approved by popular referendum.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Influenced by major uprisings that began elsewhere in the region, and compounded by additional social and economic factors, antigovernment protests broke out first in the southern province of Dar&#39;a in March 2011 with protesters calling for the repeal of the restrictive Emergency Law allowing arrests without charge, the legalization of political parties, and the removal of corrupt local officials. Demonstrations and violent unrest spread across Syria with the size and intensity of protests fluctuating. The government responded to unrest with a mix of concessions - including the repeal of the Emergency Law, new laws permitting new political parties, and liberalizing local and national elections - and with military force and detentions. The government&#39;s efforts to quell unrest and armed opposition activity led to extended clashes and eventually civil war between government forces, their allies, and oppositionists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;International pressure on the ASAD regime intensified after late 2011, as the Arab League, the EU, Turkey, and the US expanded economic sanctions against the regime and those entities that support it. In December 2012, the Syrian National Coalition, was recognized by more than 130 countries as the sole legitimate representative of the Syrian people. In September 2015, Russia launched a military intervention on behalf of the ASAD regime, and domestic and foreign government-aligned forces recaptured swaths of territory from opposition forces, and eventually the country&amp;rsquo;s second largest city, Aleppo, in December 2016, shifting the conflict in the regime&amp;rsquo;s favor. The regime, with this foreign support, also recaptured opposition strongholds in the Damascus suburbs and the southern province of Dar&amp;rsquo;a in 2018. The government lacks territorial control over much of the northeastern part of the country, which is dominated by the predominantly Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The SDF has expanded its territorial hold over much of the northeast since 2014 as it has captured territory from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Since 2016, Turkey has also conducted three large-scale military operations into Syria, capturing territory along Syria&#39;s northern border in the provinces of Aleppo, Ar Raqqah, and Al Hasakah. Political negotiations between the government and opposition delegations at UN-sponsored Geneva conferences since 2014 have failed to produce a resolution of the conflict. Since early 2017, Iran, Russia, and Turkey have held separate political negotiations outside of UN auspices to attempt to reduce violence in Syria. According to an April 2016 UN estimate, the death toll among Syrian Government forces, opposition forces, and civilians was over 400,000, though other estimates placed the number well over 500,000. As of December 2019, approximately 6 million Syrians were internally displaced. Approximately 11.1 million people were in need of humanitarian assistance across the country, and an additional 5.7 million Syrians were registered refugees in Turkey, Jordan, Iraq, Egypt, and North Africa.

SWZ,Switzerland,SZ,18-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;The Swiss Confederation was founded in 1291 as a defensive alliance among three cantons. In succeeding years, other localities joined the original three. The Swiss Confederation secured its independence from the Holy Roman Empire in 1499. A constitution of 1848, subsequently modified in 1874 to allow voters to introduce referenda on proposed laws, replaced the confederation with a centralized federal government. Switzerland&#39;s sovereignty and neutrality have long been honored by the major European powers, and the country was not involved in either of the two world wars. The political and economic integration of Europe over the past half century, as well as Switzerland&#39;s role in many UN and international organizations, has strengthened Switzerland&#39;s ties with its neighbors. However, the country did not officially become a UN member until 2002.

The global financial crisis of 2008 and resulting economic downturn in 2009 stalled demand for Swiss exports and put Switzerland into a recession. During this period, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) implemented a zero-interest rate policy to boost the economy, as well as to prevent appreciation of the franc, and Switzerland&#39;s economy began to recover in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sovereign debt crises unfolding in neighboring euro-zone countries, however, coupled with economic instability in Russia and other Eastern European economies drove up demand for the Swiss franc by investors seeking a safehaven currency. In January 2015, the SNB abandoned the Swiss francâ€™s peg to the euro, roiling global currency markets and making active SNB intervention a necessary hallmark of present-day Swiss monetary policy. The independent SNB has upheld its zero interest rate policy and conducted major market interventions to prevent further appreciation of the Swiss franc, but parliamentarians have urged it to do more to weaken the currency. The franc&#39;s strength has made Swiss exports less competitive and weakened the country&#39;s growth outlook; GDP growth fell below 2% per year from 2011 through 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Switzerland has responded to increasing pressure from neighboring countries and trading partners to reform its banking secrecy laws, by agreeing to conform to OECD regulations on administrative assistance in tax matters, including tax evasion. The Swiss Government has also renegotiated its double taxation agreements with numerous countries, including the US, to incorporate OECD standards.&lt;/p&gt;",$523.1 billion,$679 billion (2017 est.),1.70%,"$62,100 ",33.8% of GDP,53.7% (2017 est.),12% (2017 est.),24.5% (2017 est.),-1.4% (2017 est.),65.1% (2017 est.),-54% (2017 est.),0.7% (2017 est.),25.6% (2017 est.),73.7% (2017 est.),"grains, fruits, vegetables;

TCD,Trinidad and Tobago,TD,18-Dec-19,"First colonized by the Spanish, the islands came under British control in the early 19th century. The islands&#39; sugar industry was hurt by the emancipation of the slaves in 1834. Manpower was replaced with the importation of contract laborers from India between 1845 and 1917, which boosted sugar production as well as the cocoa industry. The discovery of oil on Trinidad in 1910 added another important export. Independence was attained in 1962. The country is one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean thanks largely to petroleum and natural gas production and processing. Tourism, mostly in Tobago, is targeted for expansion and is growing.

Economic growth between 2000 and 2007 averaged slightly over 8% per year, significantly above the regional average of about 3.7% for that same period; however, GDP has slowed down since then, contracting during 2009-12, making small gains in 2013 and contracting again in 2014-17. Trinidad and Tobago is buffered by considerable foreign reserves and a sovereign wealth fund that equals about one-and-a-half times the national budget, but the country is still in a recession and the government faces the dual challenge of gas shortages and a low price environment. Large-scale energy projects in the last quarter of 2017 are helping to mitigate the gas shortages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy production and downstream industrial use dominate the economy. Oil and gas typically account for about 40% of GDP and 80% of exports but less than 5% of employment. Trinidad and Tobago is home to one of the largest natural gas liquefaction facilities in the Western Hemisphere. The country produces about nine times more natural gas than crude oil on an energy equivalent basis with gas contributing about two-thirds of energy sector government revenue. The US is the countryâ€™s largest trading partner, accounting for 28% of its total imports and 48% of its exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economic diversification is a longstanding government talking point, and Trinidad and Tobago has much potential due to its stable, democratic government and its educated, English speaking workforce. The country is also a regional financial center with a well-regulated and stable financial system. Other sectors the Government of Trinidad and Tobago has targeted for increased investment and projected growth include tourism, agriculture, information and communications technology, and shipping. Unfortunately, a host of other factors, including low labor productivity, inefficient government bureaucracy, and corruption, have hampered economic development.&lt;/p&gt;",$42.85 billion,$22.78 billion (2017 est.),-2.60%,"$31,300 ",26.4% of GDP,78.9% (2017 est.),16.4% (2017 est.),8.2% (2017 est.),0.6% (2017 est.),45.4% (2017 est.),-48.7% (2017 est.),0.4% (2017 est.),47.8% (2017 est.),51.7% (2017 est.),"cocoa, dasheen, pumpkin, cassava, tomatoes, cucumbers, eggplant, hot pepper, pommecythere, coconut water, poultry","petroleum and petroleum products, liquefied natural gas, methanol, ammonia, urea, steel products, beverages, food processing, cement, cotton textiles",-4.3% (2017 est.),"629,400 (2017 est.)",3.10%,11.50%,85.4% (2016 est.),4.90%,20% (2014 est.), NA, NA,5.581 billion (2017 est.),7.446 billion (2017 est.),24.5% (of GDP) (2017 est.),-8.2% (of GDP) (2017 est.),41.8% of GDP,1 October - 30 September,1.90%,6.75%,9%,$6.72 billion,$6.72 billion,$9.718 billion,$170 million,$2.325 billion,$9.927 billion,"US 34.8%, Argentina 9% (2017)","petroleum and petroleum products, liquefied natural gas, methanol, ammonia, urea, steel products, beverages, cereal and cereal products, cocoa, fish, preserved fruits, cosmetics, household cleaners, plastic packaging",$6.105 billion,"mineral fuels, lubricants, machinery, transportation equipment, manufactured goods, food, chemicals, live animals","US 23.8%, Russia 15.3%, Colombia 11.1%, Gabon 10.5%, China 7.3% (2017)",$9.995 billion,$8.746 billion,$311.7 million,$1.266 billion,Trinidad and Tobago dollars (TTD) per US dollar -,100% (2016),10.07 billion kWh (2016 est.),9.867 billion kWh (2016 est.),0 kWh (2016 est.),0 kWh (2016 est.),2.608 million kW (2016 est.),100% of total installed capacity (2016 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),"63,000 bbl/day (2018 est.)","31,030 bbl/day (2015 est.)","80,860 bbl/day (2015 est.)",243 million bbl (1 January 2018 est.),"134,700 bbl/day (2015 est.)","51,000 bbl/day (2016 est.)","106,100 bbl/day (2015 est.)",0 bbl/day (2015 est.),36.73 billion cu m (2017 est.),21.24 billion cu m (2017 est.),15.49 billion cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),447.4 billion cu m (1 January 2018 est.),48.92 million Mt (2017 est.),"257,445",21 (2017 est.),"2,030,637",167 (2017 est.),excellent international service;

THA,Thailand,TH,18-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;A unified Thai kingdom was established in the mid-14th century. Known as Siam until 1939, Thailand is the only Southeast Asian country never to have been colonized by a European power. A bloodless revolution in 1932 led to the establishment of a constitutional monarchy. After the Japanese invaded Thailand in 1941, the government split into a pro-Japan faction and a pro-Ally faction backed by the King. Following the war, Thailand became a US treaty ally in 1954 after sending troops to Korea and later fighting alongside the US in Vietnam. Thailand since 2005 has experienced several rounds of political turmoil including a military coup in 2006 that ousted then Prime Minister THAKSIN Chinnawat, followed by large-scale street protests by competing political factions in 2008, 2009, and 2010. THAKSIN&#39;s youngest sister, YINGLAK Chinnawat, in 2011 led the Puea Thai Party to an electoral win and assumed control of the government.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In early May 2014, after months of large-scale anti-government protests in Bangkok beginning in November 2013, YINGLAK was removed from office by the Constitutional Court and in late May 2014 the Royal Thai Army, led by Royal Thai Army Gen. PRAYUT Chan-ocha, staged a coup against the caretaker government. PRAYUT was appointed prime minister in August 2014. PRAYUT also serves as the head of the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), a military-affiliated body that oversees the interim government. This body created several interim institutions to promote reform and draft a new constitution, which was passed in a national referendum in August 2016. In late 2017, PRAYUT announced elections would be held by November 2018; he has subsequently suggested they might occur in February 2019. As of mid-December 2018, a previoulsy held ban on campaigning and political activity has been lifted and per parliamentary laws, an election must be held within 150 days. King PHUMIPHON Adunyadet passed away in October 2016 after 70 years on the throne; his only son, WACHIRALONGKON Bodinthrathepphayawarangkun, ascended the throne in December 2016. He signed the new constitution in April 2017. Thailand has also experienced violence associated with the ethno-nationalist insurgency in its southern Malay-Muslim majority provinces. Since January 2004, thousands have been killed and wounded in the insurgency.&lt;/p&gt;","Southeastern Asia, bordering the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand, southeast of Burma","15 00 N, 100 00 E",Southeast Asia,"513,120 sq km","510,890 sq km","2,230 sq km",about three times the size of Florida;

authoritiesâ€™ efforts to screen for victims among vulnerable populations remained inadequate due to a poor understanding of trafficking indicators, a failure to recognize non-physical forms of coercion, and a shortage of language interpreters; the government passed new labor laws increasing the minimum age in the fishing industry to 18 years old, guaranteeing the minimum wage, and requiring work contracts, but weak law enforcement and poor coordination among regulatory agencies enabled exploitive labor practices to continue;

TTO,Timor-Leste,TT,19-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;The Portuguese began to trade with the island of Timor in the early 16th century and colonized it in mid-century. Skirmishing with the Dutch in the region eventually resulted in an 1859 treaty in which Portugal ceded the western portion of the island. Imperial Japan occupied Portuguese Timor from 1942 to 1945, but Portugal resumed colonial authority after the Japanese defeat in World War II. East Timor declared itself independent from Portugal on 28 November 1975 and was invaded and occupied by Indonesian forces nine days later. It was incorporated into Indonesia in July 1976 as the province of Timor Timur (East Timor). An unsuccessful campaign of pacification followed over the next two decades, during which an estimated 100,000 to 250,000 people died. In an August 1999 UN-supervised popular referendum, an overwhelming majority of the people of Timor-Leste voted for independence from Indonesia. However, in the next three weeks, anti-independence Timorese militias - organized and supported by the Indonesian military - commenced a large-scale, scorched-earth campaign of retribution. The militias killed approximately 1,400 Timorese and forced 300,000 people into western Timor as refugees. Most of the country&#39;s infrastructure, including homes, irrigation systems, water supply systems, and schools, and nearly all of the country&#39;s electrical grid were destroyed. On 20 September 1999, Australian-led peacekeeping troops deployed to the country and brought the violence to an end. On 20 May 2002, Timor-Leste was internationally recognized as an independent state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2006, internal tensions threatened the new nation&#39;s security when a military strike led to violence and a breakdown of law and order. At Dili&#39;s request, an Australian-led International Stabilization Force (ISF) deployed to Timor-Leste, and the UN Security Council established the UN Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT), which included an authorized police presence of over 1,600 personnel. The ISF and UNMIT restored stability, allowing for presidential and parliamentary elections in 2007 in a largely peaceful atmosphere. In February 2008, a rebel group staged an unsuccessful attack against the president and prime minister. The ringleader was killed in the attack, and most of the rebels surrendered in April 2008. Since the attack, the government has enjoyed one of its longest periods of post-independence stability, including successful 2012 elections for both the parliament and president and a successful transition of power in February 2015. In late 2012, the UN Security Council ended its peacekeeping mission in Timor-Leste and both the ISF and UNMIT departed the country. Early parliamentary elections in the spring of 2017 finally produced a majority goovernment after months of impasse. Currently, the government is a coalition of three parties and the president is a member of the opposition party. In 2018 and 2019, this configuration stymied nominations for key ministerial positions and slowed progress on certain policy issues.&lt;/p&gt;","Southeastern Asia, northwest of Australia in the Lesser Sunda Islands at the eastern end of the Indonesian archipelago;

The development of offshore oil and gas resources has greatly supplemented government revenues. This technology-intensive industry, however, has done little to create jobs in part because there are no production facilities in Timor-Leste. Gas is currently piped to Australia for processing, but Timor-Leste has expressed interest in developing a domestic processing capability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 2005, the National Parliament unanimously approved the creation of the Timor-Leste Petroleum Fund to serve as a repository for all petroleum revenues and to preserve the value of Timor-Leste&#39;s petroleum wealth for future generations. The Fund held assets of $16 billion, as of mid-2016. Oil accounts for over 90% of government revenues, and the drop in the price of oil in 2014-16 has led to concerns about the long-term sustainability of government spending. Timor-Leste compensated for the decline in price by exporting more oil. The Ministry of Finance maintains that the Petroleum Fund is sufficient to sustain government operations for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annual government budget expenditures increased markedly between 2009 and 2012 but dropped significantly through 2016. Historically, the government failed to spend as much as its budget allowed. The government has focused significant resources on basic infrastructure, including electricity and roads, but limited experience in procurement and infrastructure building has hampered these projects. The underlying economic policy challenge the country faces remains how best to use oil-and-gas wealth to lift the non-oil economy onto a higher growth path and to reduce poverty.&lt;/p&gt;",$7.426 billion,$2.775 billion (2017 est.),-4.60%,"$6,000 ",,33% (2017 est.),30% (2017 est.),10.6% (2017 est.),0% (2017 est.),78.4% (2017 est.),-52% (2017 est.),9.1% (2017 est.),56.7% (2017 est.),34.4% (2017 est.),"coffee, rice, corn, cassava (manioc, tapioca), sweet potatoes, soybeans, cabbage, mangoes, bananas, vanilla","printing, soap manufacturing, handicrafts, woven cloth",2% (2017 est.),"286,700 (2016 est.)",41%,13%,45.1% (2013),4.40%,41.8% (2014 est.),4%,27% (2007),300 million (2017 est.),2.4 billion (2017 est.),10.8% (of GDP) (2017 est.),-75.7% (of GDP) (2017 est.),3.8% of GDP,calendar year,0.60%,,14.05%,$464.1 million,$464.1 million,-$212 million,&lt;p&gt;NA&lt;/p&gt;,-$284 million,$16.7 million,,"oil, coffee, sandalwood, marble",$681.2 million,"food, gasoline, kerosene, machinery",,$437.8 million,$687 million,,,,,0 kWh NA (2016 est.),0 kWh (2016 est.),0 kWh (2017 est.),0 kWh (2016 est.),600 kW NA (2016 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2016 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),100% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),"33,000 bbl/day (2018 est.)","62,060 bbl/day (2015 est.)",0 bbl/day (2015 est.),0 bbl (1 January 2018 est.),0 bbl/day (2015 est.),"3,500 bbl/day (2016 est.)",0 bbl/day (2015 est.),"3,481 bbl/day (2015 est.)",5.776 billion cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),5.776 billion cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),200 billion cu m (1 January 2006 est.),"533,400 Mt (2017 est.)","2,364", less than 1 (2017 est.),"1,546,624",120 (2017 est.),"rudimentary service in urban and some rural areas, which is expanding with the entrance of new competitors;

Progress in reducing the birth rate has stalled, sustaining the countryâ€™s nearly 3% annual growth. The maternal mortality rate has improved since 2000, yet it remains very high because of early and frequent pregnancies, inadequate maternal health services, and a lack of skilled birth attendants â€“ problems that are worse among poor and rural women.

However, the assisted repatriation and naturalization of tens of thousands of Burundian refugees between 2002 and 2014 dramatically reduced the refugee population.

Agriculture is one of the most important sectors of the economy, employing 72% of the work force. The countryâ€™s export market suffered a major slump following the outbreak of conflict in South Sudan, but has recovered lately, largely due to record coffee harvests, which account for 16% of exports, and increasing gold exports, which account for 10% of exports. Uganda has a small industrial sector that is dependent on imported inputs such as refined oil and heavy equipment. Overall, productivity is hampered by a number of supply-side constraints, including insufficient infrastructure, lack of modern technology in agriculture, and corruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ugandaâ€™s economic growth has slowed since 2016 as government spending and public debt has grown. Ugandaâ€™s budget is dominated by energy and road infrastructure spending, while Uganda relies on donor support for long-term drivers of growth, including agriculture, health, and education. The largest infrastructure projects are externally financed through concessional loans, but at inflated costs. As a result, debt servicing for these loans is expected to rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil revenues and taxes are expected to become a larger source of government funding as oil production starts in the next three to 10 years. Over the next three to five years, foreign investors are planning to invest $9 billion in production facilities projects, $4 billion in an export pipeline, as well as in a $2-3 billion refinery to produce petroleum products for the domestic and East African Community markets. Furthermore, the government is looking to build several hundred million dollarsâ€™ worth of highway projects to the oil region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uganda faces many economic challenges. Instability in South Sudan has led to a sharp increase in Sudanese refugees and is disrupting Uganda&#39;s main export market. Additional economic risks include: poor economic management, endemic corruption, and the governmentâ€™s failure to invest adequately in the health, education, and economic opportunities for a burgeoning young population. Uganda has one of the lowest electrification rates in Africa - only 22% of Ugandans have access to electricity, dropping to 10% in rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;",$89.19 billion,$26.62 billion (2017 est.),4.80%,"$2,400 ",20.6% of GDP,74.3% (2017 est.),8% (2017 est.),23.9% (2017 est.),0.3% (2017 est.),18.8% (2017 est.),-25.1% (2017 est.),28.2% (2017 est.),21.1% (2017 est.),50.7% (2017 est.),"coffee, tea, cotton, tobacco, cassava (manioc, tapioca), potatoes, corn, millet, pulses, cut flowers; beef, goat meat, milk, poultry, and fish","sugar processing, brewing, tobacco, cotton textiles; cement, steel production",4.4% (2017 est.),15.84 million (2015 est.),71%,7%,22% (2013 est.),9.40%,21.4% (2017 est.),2.40%,36.1% (2009 est.),3.848 billion (2017 est.),4.928 billion (2017 est.),14.5% (of GDP) (2017 est.),-4.1% (of GDP) (2017 est.),40% of GDP,1 July - 30 June,5.60%,9.50%,23.89%,$2.167 billion,$2.167 billion,$3.989 billion,$1.788 billion,-$1.212 billion,$3.339 billion,"Kenya 17.7%, UAE 16.7%, Democratic Republic of the Congo 6.6%, Rwanda 6.1%, Italy 4.8% (2017)","coffee, fish and fish products, tea, cotton, flowers, horticultural products; gold",$5.036 billion,"capital equipment, vehicles, petroleum, medical supplies; cereals","China 17.4%, India 13.4%, UAE 12.2%, Kenya 7.9%, Japan 6.4%, Saudi Arabia 6.3%, Indonesia 4.4%, South Africa 4.1% (2017)",$3.034 billion,$6.241 billion,$541 million,&lt;p&gt;NA&lt;/p&gt;,Ugandan shillings (UGX) per US dollar -,,3.463 billion kWh (2016 est.),3.106 billion kWh (2016 est.),121 million kWh (2015 est.),50 million kWh (2016 est.),1.02 million kW (2016 est.),19% of total installed capacity (2016 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),68% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),12% of total installed capacity (2017 est.),0 bbl/day (2018 est.),0 bbl/day (2015 est.),0 bbl/day (2015 est.),2.5 billion bbl (1 January 2018 est.),0 bbl/day (2015 est.),"32,000 bbl/day (2016 est.)",0 bbl/day (2015 est.),"31,490 bbl/day (2015 est.)",0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),0 cu m (2017 est.),14.16 billion cu m (1 January 2018 est.),4.703 million Mt (2017 est.),"262,286",1 (2017 est.),"24,948,878",63 (2017 est.),"in recent years, telecommunications infrastructure has developed through private partnerships; private companies have laid over 1,800 km of fiber optics in Uganda since 2015; as of 2018, fixed fiber backbone infrastructure is available in over half of Uganda&amp;rsquo;s districts; mobile phone companies now provide 4G networks across all major cities and national parks, while offering 3G coverage in second-tier cities and most rural areas with road access; between 2016 and 2018, commercial Internet services dropped in price from $300/Mbps to $80/Mbps.

Except in urban areas, actual fertility exceeds womenâ€™s desired fertility by one or two children, which is indicative of the widespread unmet need for contraception, lack of government support for family planning, and a cultural preference for large families. High numbers of births, short birth intervals, and the early age of childbearing contribute to Ugandaâ€™s high maternal mortality rate. Gender inequities also make fertility reduction difficult; women on average are less-educated, participate less in paid employment, and often have little say in decisions over childbearing and their own reproductive health. However, even if the birth rate were significantly reduced, Ugandaâ€™s large pool of women entering reproductive age ensures rapid population growth for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unchecked, population increase will further strain the availability of arable land and natural resources and overwhelm the countryâ€™s limited means for providing food, employment, education, health care, housing, and basic services. The countryâ€™s north and northeast lag even further behind developmentally than the rest of the country as a result of long-term conflict (the Ugandan Bush War 1981-1986 and more than 20 years of fighting between the Lordâ€™s Resistance Army (LRA) and Ugandan Government forces), ongoing inter-communal violence, and periodic natural disasters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uganda has been both a source of refugees and migrants and a host country for refugees. In 1972, then President Idi AMIN, in his drive to return Uganda to Ugandans, expelled the South Asian population that composed a large share of the countryâ€™s business people and bankers. Since the 1970s, thousands of Ugandans have emigrated, mainly to southern Africa or the West, for security reasons, to escape poverty, to search for jobs, and for access to natural resources. The emigration of Ugandan doctors and nurses due to low wages is a particular concern given the countryâ€™s shortage of skilled health care workers. Africans escaping conflicts in neighboring states have found refuge in Uganda since the 1950s; the country currently struggles to host tens of thousands from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan, and other nearby countries.&lt;/p&gt;","1,244 km (2014)",,"1,244 km 1.000-m gauge (2014)",,,&lt;strong&gt;aim(s):&lt;/strong&gt; punish Ugandan Government for participating in African Union military operations against al-Shabaab; compel Uganda to withdraw forces from Somalia&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;area(s) of operation:&lt;/strong&gt; aspires to renew attacks in Kampala; no permanent presence (2018),,,,,none (landlocked),,,schistosomiasis (2016),rabies (2016),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,President Yoweri Kaguta MUSEVENI (since seizing power on 26 January 1986); Vice President Edward SSEKANDI (since 24 May 2011); note - the president is both head of state and head of government,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the 19th and 20th centuries, 37 new states were added to the original 13 as the nation expanded across the North American continent and acquired a number of overseas possessions. The two most traumatic experiences in the nation&#39;s history were the Civil War (1861-65), in which a northern Union of states defeated a secessionist Confederacy of 11 southern slave states, and the Great Depression of the 1930s, an economic downturn during which about a quarter of the labor force lost its jobs.

US firms are at or near the forefront in technological advances, especially in computers, pharmaceuticals, and medical, aerospace, and military equipment; however, their advantage has narrowed since the end of World War II. Based on a comparison of GDP measured at purchasing power parity conversion rates, the US economy in 2014, having stood as the largest in the world for more than a century, slipped into second place behind China, which has more than tripled the US growth rate for each year of the past four decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US, private individuals and business firms make most of the decisions, and the federal and state governments buy needed goods and services predominantly in the private marketplace. US business firms enjoy greater flexibility than their counterparts in Western Europe and Japan in decisions to expand capital plant, to lay off surplus workers, and to develop new products. At the same time, businesses face higher barriers to enter their rivals&#39; home markets than foreign firms face entering US markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term problems for the US include stagnation of wages for lower-income families, inadequate investment in deteriorating infrastructure, rapidly rising medical and pension costs of an aging population, energy shortages, and sizable current account and budget deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The onrush of technology has been a driving factor in the gradual development of a &quot;two-tier&quot; labor market in which those at the bottom lack the education and the professional/technical skills of those at the top and, more and more, fail to get comparable pay raises, health insurance coverage, and other benefits. But the globalization of trade, and especially the rise of low-wage producers such as China, has put additional downward pressure on wages and upward pressure on the return to capital. Since 1975, practically all the gains in household income have gone to the top 20% of households. Since 1996, dividends and capital gains have grown faster than wages or any other category of after-tax income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imported oil accounts for more than 50% of US consumption and oil has a major impact on the overall health of the economy. Crude oil prices doubled between 2001 and 2006, the year home prices peaked; higher gasoline prices ate into consumers&#39; budgets and many individuals fell behind in their mortgage payments. Oil prices climbed another 50% between 2006 and 2008, and bank foreclosures more than doubled in the same period. Besides dampening the housing market, soaring oil prices caused a drop in the value of the dollar and a deterioration in the US merchandise trade deficit, which peaked at $840 billion in 2008. Because the US economy is energy-intensive, falling oil prices since 2013 have alleviated many of the problems the earlier increases had created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sub-prime mortgage crisis, falling home prices, investment bank failures, tight credit, and the global economic downturn pushed the US into a recession by mid-2008. GDP contracted until the third quarter of 2009, the deepest and longest downturn since the Great Depression. To help stabilize financial markets, the US Congress established a $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program in October 2008. The government used some of these funds to purchase equity in US banks and industrial corporations, much of which had been returned to the government by early 2011. In January 2009, Congress passed and former President Barack OBAMA signed a bill providing an additional $787 billion fiscal stimulus to be used over 10 years - two-thirds on additional spending and one-third on tax cuts - to create jobs and to help the economy recover. In 2010 and 2011, the federal budget deficit reached nearly 9% of GDP. In 2012, the Federal Government reduced the growth of spending and the deficit shrank to 7.6% of GDP. US revenues from taxes and other sources are lower, as a percentage of GDP, than those of most other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan required major shifts in national resources from civilian to military purposes and contributed to the growth of the budget deficit and public debt. Through FY 2018, the direct costs of the wars will have totaled more than $1.9 trillion, according to US Government figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2010, former President OBAMA signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), a health insurance reform that was designed to extend coverage to an additional 32 million Americans by 2016, through private health insurance for the general population and Medicaid for the impoverished. Total spending on healthcare - public plus private - rose from 9.0% of GDP in 1980 to 17.9% in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 2010, the former president signed the DODD-FRANK Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a law designed to promote financial stability by protecting consumers from financial abuses, ending taxpayer bailouts of financial firms, dealing with troubled banks that are &quot;too big to fail,&quot; and improving accountability and transparency in the financial system - in particular, by requiring certain financial derivatives to be traded in markets that are subject to government regulation and oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve Board (Fed) announced plans in December 2012 to purchase $85 billion per month of mortgage-backed and Treasury securities in an effort to hold down long-term interest rates, and to keep short-term rates near zero until unemployment dropped below 6.5% or inflation rose above 2.5%. The Fed ended its purchases during the summer of 2014, after the unemployment rate dropped to 6.2%, inflation stood at 1.7%, and public debt fell below 74% of GDP. In December 2015, the Fed raised its target for the benchmark federal funds rate by 0.25%, the first increase since the recession began. With continued low growth, the Fed opted to raise rates several times since then, and in December 2017, the target rate stood at 1.5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2017, Congress passed and President Donald TRUMP signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which, among its various provisions, reduces the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; lowers the individual tax rate for those with the highest incomes from 39.6% to 37%, and by lesser percentages for those at lower income levels; changes many deductions and credits used to calculate taxable income; and eliminates in 2019 the penalty imposed on taxpayers who do not obtain the minimum amount of health insurance required under the ACA. The new taxes took effect on 1 January 2018; the tax cut for corporations are permanent, but those for individuals are scheduled to expire after 2025. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) under the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the new law will reduce tax revenues and increase the federal deficit by about $1.45 trillion over the 2018-2027 period.

URY,Uruguay,UY,18-Dec-19,"&lt;p&gt;Montevideo, founded by the Spanish in 1726 as a military stronghold, soon took advantage of its natural harbor to become an important commercial center. Claimed by Argentina but annexed by Brazil in 1821, Uruguay declared its independence four years later and secured its freedom in 1828 after a three-year struggle. The administrations of President Jose BATLLE in the early 20th century launched widespread political, social, and economic reforms that established a statist tradition. A violent Marxist urban guerrilla movement named the Tupamaros, launched in the late 1960s, led Uruguay&#39;s president to cede control of the government to the military in 1973. By yearend, the rebels had been crushed, but the military continued to expand its hold over the government. Civilian rule was restored in 1985. In 2004, the left-of-center Frente Amplio Coalition won national elections that effectively ended 170 years of political control previously held by the Colorado and National (Blanco) parties.

The 2008-09 global financial crisis put a brake on Uruguay&#39;s vigorous growth, which decelerated to 2.6% in 2009. Nevertheless, the country avoided a recession and kept growth rates positive, mainly through higher public expenditure and investment; GDP growth reached 8.9% in 2010 but slowed markedly in the 2012-16 period as a result of a renewed slowdown in the global economy and in Uruguay&#39;s main trade partners and Mercosur counterparts, Argentina and Brazil.

UZB,Uzbekistan,UZ,19-Dec-19,"Uzbekistan is the geographic and population center of Central Asia. The country has a diverse economy and a relatively young population. Russia conquered and united the disparate territories of present-day Uzbekistan in the late 19th century. Stiff resistance to the Red Army after the Bolshevik Revolution was eventually suppressed and a socialist republic established in 1924. During the Soviet era, intensive production of &quot;white gold&quot; (cotton) and grain led to the overuse of agrochemicals and the depletion of water supplies, leaving the land degraded and the Aral Sea and certain rivers half-dry. Independent since the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, the country has diversified agricultural production while developing its mineral and petroleum export capacity and increasing its manufacturing base, although cotton remains a major part of its economy. Uzbekistan&amp;rsquo;s first president, Islam KARIMOV, led Uzbekistan for 25 years until his death in September 2016. His successor, former Prime Minister Shavkat MIRZIYOYEV, has improved relations with Uzbekistan&amp;rsquo;s neighbors and introduced wide-ranging economic, judicial, and social reforms.","Central Asia, north of Turkmenistan, south of Kazakhstan","41 00 N, 64 00 E",Asia,"447,400 sq km","425,400 sq km","22,000 sq km",about four times the size of Virginia;

Since its independence in September 1991, the government has largely maintained its Soviet-style command economy with subsidies and tight controls on production, prices, and access to foreign currency. Despite ongoing efforts to diversify crops, Uzbek agriculture remains largely centered on cotton; Uzbekistan is the world&#39;s fifth-largest cotton exporter and seventh-largest producer. Uzbekistan&#39;s growth has been driven primarily by state-led investments, and export of natural gas, gold, and cotton provides a significant share of foreign exchange earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, lower global commodity prices and economic slowdowns in neighboring Russia and China have hurt Uzbekistan&#39;s trade and investment and worsened its foreign currency shortage. Aware of the need to improve the investment climate, the government is taking incremental steps to reform the business sector and address impediments to foreign investment in the country. Since the death of first President Islam KARIMOV and election of President Shavkat MIRZIYOYEV, emphasis on such initiatives and government efforts to improve the private sector have increased. In the past, Uzbek authorities accused US and other foreign companies operating in Uzbekistan of violating Uzbek laws and have frozen and seized their assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a part of its economic reform efforts, the Uzbek Government is looking to expand opportunities for small and medium enterprises and prioritizes increasing foreign direct investment.

VCT,Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,VC,18-Dec-19,"Resistance by native Caribs prevented colonization on Saint Vincent until 1719. Disputed between France and the UK for most of the 18th century, the island was ceded to the latter in 1783. The British prized Saint Vincent due to its fertile soil, which allowed for thriving slave-run plantations of sugar, coffee, indigo, tobacco, cotton, and cocoa. In 1834, the British abolished slavery. Immigration of indentured servants eased the ensuing labor shortage, as did subsequent Portuguese immigrants from Madeira and East Indian laborers. Conditions remained harsh for both former slaves and immigrant agricultural workers, however, as depressed world sugar prices kept the economy stagnant until the early 1900s. The economy then went into a period of decline with many landowners abandoning their estates and leaving the land to be cultivated by liberated slaves. Between 1960 and 1962, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was a separate administrative unit of the Federation of the West Indies. Autonomy was granted in 1969 and independence in 1979.","Caribbean, islands between the Caribbean Sea and North Atlantic Ocean, north of Trinidad and Tobago","13 15 N, 61 12 W",Central America and the Caribbean,389 sq km (Saint Vincent 344 sq km),389 sq km,0 sq km,"twice the size of Washington, DC",,,84 km,12 nm,200 nm,24 nm,200 nm,tropical;

VEN,Venezuela,VE,19-Dec-19,"Venezuela was one of three countries that emerged from the collapse of Gran Colombia in 1830 (the others being Ecuador and New Granada, which became Colombia). For most of the first half of the 20th century, Venezuela was ruled by generally benevolent military strongmen who promoted the oil industry and allowed for some social reforms. Democratically elected governments have held sway since 1959, although the re-election of current disputed President Nicolas MADURO in an election boycotted by most opposition parties was widely viewed as fraudulent. Under Hugo CHAVEZ, president from 1999 to 2013, and his hand-picked successor, MADURO, the executive branch has exercised increasingly authoritarian control over other branches of government. National Assembly President Juan GUAIDO is currently recognized by more than 50 countries - including the United States - as the interim president while MADURO retains control of all other institutions within the country and has the support of security forces. Venezuela is currently authoritarian with only one democratic institution - the National Assembly - and strong restrictions on freedoms of expression and the press. The ruling party&#39;s economic policies expanded the state&#39;s role in the economy through expropriations of major enterprises, strict currency exchange and price controls that discourage private sector investment and production, and overdependence on the petroleum industry for revenues, among others. However, Caracas in 2019 relaxed some economic controls to mitigate some impacts of the economic crisis driven by a drop in oil production. Current concerns include human rights abuses, rampant violent crime, high inflation, and widespread shortages of basic consumer goods, medicine, and medical supplies.","Northern South America, bordering the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, between Colombia and Guyana","8 00 N, 66 00 W",South America,"912,050 sq km","882,050 sq km","30,000 sq km",almost six times the size of Georgia;

In the absence of official statistics, foreign experts estimate that GDP contracted 12% in 2017, inflation exceeded 2000%, people faced widespread shortages of consumer goods and medicine, and the central bank&#39;s international reserves dwindled. In late 2017, Venezuela also entered selective default on some of its sovereign and state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A., (PDVSA) bonds. Domestic production and industry continues to severely underperform and the Venezuelan Government continues to rely on imports to meet its basic food and consumer goods needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Falling oil prices since 2014 have aggravated Venezuelaâ€™s economic crisis. Insufficient access to dollars, price controls, and rigid labor regulations have led some US and multinational firms to reduce or shut down their Venezuelan operations. Market uncertainty and PDVSAâ€™s poor cash flow have slowed investment in the petroleum sector, resulting in a decline in oil production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under President Nicolas MADURO, the Venezuelan Governmentâ€™s response to the economic crisis has been to increase state control over the economy and blame the private sector for shortages. MADURO has given authority for the production and distribution of basic goods to the military and to local socialist party member committees. The Venezuelan Government has maintained strict currency controls since 2003. The government has been unable to sustain its mechanisms for distributing dollars to the private sector, in part because it needed to withhold some foreign exchange reserves to make its foreign bond payments. As a result of price and currency controls, local industries have struggled to purchase production inputs necessary to maintain their operations or sell goods at a profit on the local market. Expansionary monetary policies and currency controls have created opportunities for arbitrage and corruption and fueled a rapid increase in black market activity.&lt;/p&gt;",$381.6 billion,$210.1 billion (2017 est.),-14%,"$12,500 ",12.1% of GDP,68.5% (2017 est.),19.6% (2017 est.),13.9% (2017 est.),1.7% (2017 est.),7% (2017 est.),-10.7% (2017 est.),4.7% (2017 est.),40.4% (2017 est.),54.9% (2017 est.),"corn, sorghum, sugarcane, rice, bananas, vegetables, coffee;

dedicated to education, nutrition, healthcare, and sanitation were funded through petroleum revenues. The sustainability of this progress remains questionable, however, as the continuation of these social programs depends on the prosperity of Venezuela&#39;s oil industry. In the long-term, education and health care spending may increase economic growth and reduce income inequality, but rising costs and the staffing of new health care jobs with foreigners are slowing development.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While CHAVEZ was in power, more than one million predominantly middle- and upper-class Venezuelans are estimated to have emigrated. The brain drain is attributed to a repressive political system, lack of economic opportunities, steep inflation, a high crime rate, and corruption. Thousands of oil engineers emigrated to Canada, Colombia, and the United States following CHAVEZ&#39;s firing of over 20,000 employees of the state-owned petroleum company during a 2002-03 oil strike. Additionally, thousands of Venezuelans of European descent have taken up residence in their ancestral homelands. Nevertheless, Venezuela has attracted hundreds of thousands of immigrants from South America and southern Europe because of its lenient migration policy and the availability of education and health care. Venezuela also has been a fairly accommodating host to Colombian refugees, numbering about 170,000 as of year-end 2016. However, since 2014, falling oil prices have driven a major economic crisis that has pushed Venezuelans from all walks of life to migrate or to seek asylum abroad to escape severe shortages of food, water, and medicine; soaring inflation; unemployment; and violence. As of November 2019, an estimated&amp;nbsp;4.6 million Venezuelans were refugees or migrants worldwide, with&amp;nbsp;almost 80% taking refuge&amp;nbsp;in Latin America and the Caribbean (notably Colombia, Peru, Chile, Ecuador, Argentina, and Brazil, as well as the Dominican Republic, Aruba, and Curacao). Asylum applications increased significantly in the US and Brazil in 2016 and 2017. Several receiving countries are making efforts to increase immigration restrictions and to deport illegal Venezuelan migrants - Ecuador and Peru in August 2018 began requiring valid passports for entry, which are difficult to obtain for Venezuelans.

It has a nominal GDP of $844 million. Agriculture, including fishing, furnishes 90% of exports, featuring fish, coconut oil, nonu products, and taro. The manufacturing sector mainly processes agricultural products. Industry accounts for nearly 22% of GDP while employing less than 6% of the work force. The service sector accounts for nearly two-thirds of GDP and employs approximately 50% of the labor force. Tourism is an expanding sector accounting for 25% of GDP; 132,000 tourists visited the islands in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country is vulnerable to devastating storms. In September 2009, an earthquake and the resulting tsunami severely damaged Samoa and nearby American Samoa, disrupting transportation and power generation, and resulting in about 200 deaths.

ZAF,Zambia,ZA,27-Dec-19,"The territory of Northern Rhodesia was administered by the former British South Africa Company from 1891 until it was taken over by the UK in 1923. During the 1920s and 1930s, advances in mining spurred development and immigration. The name was changed to Zambia upon independence in 1964. In the 1980s and 1990s, declining copper prices, economic mismanagement, and a prolonged drought hurt the economy. Elections in 1991 brought an end to one-party rule and propelled the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) to government. The subsequent vote in 1996, however, saw increasing harassment of opposition parties and abuse of state media and other resources. The election in 2001 was marked by administrative problems, with three parties filing a legal petition challenging the election of ruling party candidate Levy MWANAWASA. MWANAWASA was reelected in 2006 in an election that was deemed free and fair. Upon his death in August 2008, he was succeeded by his vice president, Rupiah BANDA, who won a special presidential byelection later that year. The MMD and BANDA lost to the Patriotic Front (PF) and Michael SATA in the 2011 general elections. SATA, however, presided over a period of haphazard economic management and attempted to silence opposition to PF policies. SATA died in October 2014 and was succeeded by his vice president, Guy SCOTT, who served as interim president until January 2015, when Edgar LUNGU won the presidential byelection and completed SATA&#39;s term. LUNGU then won a full term in August 2016 presidential elections.","Southern Africa, east of Angola, south of the Democratic Republic of the Congo","15 00 S, 30 00 E",Africa,"752,618 sq km","743,398 sq km","9,220 sq km",almost five times the size of Georgia;

Zambiaâ€™s lack of economic diversification and dependency on copper as its sole major export makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in the world commodities market and prices turned downward in 2015 due to declining demand from China; Zambia was overtaken by the Democratic Republic of Congo as Africaâ€™s largest copper producer. GDP growth picked up in 2017 as mineral prices rose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite recent strong economic growth and its status as a lower middle-income country, widespread and extreme rural poverty and high unemployment levels remain significant problems, made worse by a high birth rate, a relatively high HIV/AIDS burden, by market-distorting agricultural and energy policies, and growing government debt. Zambia raised $7 billion from international investors by issuing separate sovereign bonds in 2012, 2014, and 2015.

Zambiaâ€™s high fertility rate continues to drive rapid population growth, averaging almost 3 percent annually between 2000 and 2010. The countryâ€™s total fertility rate has fallen by less than 1.5 children per woman during the last 30 years and still averages among the worldâ€™s highest, almost 6 children per woman, largely because of the countryâ€™s lack of access to family planning services, education for girls, and employment for women. Zambia also exhibits wide fertility disparities based on rural or urban location, education, and income. Poor, uneducated women from rural areas are more likely to marry young, to give birth early, and to have more children, viewing children as a sign of prestige and recognizing that not all of their children will live to adulthood. HIV/AIDS is prevalent in Zambia and contributes to its low life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zambian emigration is low compared to many other African countries and is comprised predominantly of the well-educated. The small amount of brain drain, however, has a major impact in Zambia because of its limited human capital and lack of educational infrastructure for developing skilled professionals in key fields. For example, Zambia has few schools for training doctors, nurses, and other health care workers. Its spending on education is low compared to other sub-Saharan countries.&lt;/p&gt;","3,126 km (2014)",,"3,126 km 1.067-m gauge (2014)",,,,"46,384 (Democratic Republic of the Congo) (refugees and asylum seekers), 18,179 (Angola), 6,419 (Burundi), 5,849 (Rwanda) (2019)",,,,none (landlocked),,,schistosomiasis (2016),rabies (2016),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
